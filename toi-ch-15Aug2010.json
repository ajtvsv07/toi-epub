wants Rs. 1,500cr from Dow for Bhopal","post":"\u000a      <b>Govt wants 1,500cr from Dow for Bhopal </b>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <font size=\"1\">\u000a        <i>Dhananjay Mahapatra | TNN </i>\u000a      </font>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <br>New Delhi: More than 20 years after the Supreme Court-supervised Bhopal gas victims compensation package of $470 million was worked out,the Centre has decided to seek additional compensation of over Rs 1,500 crores from Dow Chemicals and its subsidiary,Union Carbide,for providing relief to the victims.<br>The ministry of chemicals and fertilizers (MoCF) is giving final touches to the curative petition to seek reworking of the compensation package worked out between Union Carbide (UC) and the Union government in 1989.A petition seeking review of the February 1989 judgment was dismissed on October 3,1991.<br>Given the decision of the Group of Ministers (GoM) to uniformly give Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those who died in the worst ever industrial disaster on the night of December 2-3,1984,when deadly methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the UC plant in Bhopal,the ministry feels that the gradation made by the apex court for compensation was not correct.<br>Moreover,the SC helped the UC and the government reach a figure of $470 million on the basis of the assumption that there were 3,000 deaths and the number of injured was around 20,000.But when compensation was paid,the death figure had touched almost 6,000 and the number of injured totalled nearly 6 lakh.So the money paid by UC to be distributed among the kin of 3,000 dead and 20,000 injured got spread between the kin of 6,000 dead and among the 6 lakh injured,reducing their share by more than half.<br>These are very conservative figures given the magnitude of the tragedy and hence the compensation amount Union Carbide was asked to pay was only a fraction of its liability, sources in the ministry said,adding that the government would make all out efforts to seek an extra Rs 1,500-2,000 crores.<br>They said that although no amount of compensation or rehabilitation could substitute for the loss of innocent lives,the state was nevertheless duty bound to ensure that the persons responsible for the calamity paid reasonable compensation to the affected people.Dow Chemicals Company may have denied any responsibility for the damage caused by Union Carbide in Bhopal,but the government is positive about fixing liability on it as it had done for Union Carbide to fight over 75,000 asbestos related law suits in the United States.Union Carbide became a subsidiary of Dow through a merger in 2001.<b><br><br>Relief for gas victims </b><br><br>Union Carbide had earlier paid $470 million as compensation At that time,the number of those killed by the gas leak was estimated at 3,000 and the injured at 20,000 But when the money was distributed,the death figure had touched 6,000 and the number of injured 6 lakh The government now wants to seek an extra 1,500-2,000 crores to distribute among the victims A group of ministers had recently hiked compensation for the kin of those dead to 10 lakh

police caught him on Friday.<br>Silver Srinivasan,78,who only steals silver items,first saw the inside of a jail in 1966.He was then arrested for stealing a silver tumbler during a wedding in Tiruchi.Since then,he has been involved in more than 100 cases and jailed almost as many times.<br>Srinivasan has spent more time in jail than outside it,say advocates and jail authorities.But Silver, as he is known among fellow prisoners and authorities,has his principles.Rule number one is that he only steals silver articles.If I come across about 100 sovereigns of gold,I either leave it untouched or take just one or two sovereigns.If I take the entire lot,the family would be ruined.Not many would go to the police for the loss of one or two sovereigns, he told the police.If it is silver,I lift the entire lot. <br>Rule number two is that he only targets the homes of Brahmin families.A Srirangam-born Iyengar,Silver  told a judicial magistrate that he was ashamed of himself after he was first convicted in 1966.Once out of Tiruchi Central Prison,he headed to a mutt and confessed.He told them he wanted to go straight,and sought a job there.<br>Silver says he was thrown out of the mutt  and thus decided to make Brahmin families pay.<br>Rule number three is that he never contests charges.Every time he is arrested,Silver waits some months and then pleads guilty and gets a minor sentence.After a few months behind bars,he gets out and starts planning his next heist.<br>Dressed in a white veshti and speaking with a Brahminical accent,Silver looks more like a welldressed cook than a habitual offender.He usually targets women,pretending to be a distant relative or a friend.A confirmed bachelor,he has had a colourful life with a string of girlfriends across Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.<br>His conduct in jail Perfect, says a jail official.Most officials prefer to have him as an orderly as he assists them promptly.<br>On Saturday,Chennai suburban police commissioner SR Jangid said police began an investigation based on a complaint from a Pazhavanthangal resident,stating that an elderly man had stolen silver valuables from his house.They picked up Silver Srinivasan,who confessed.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/1/Img/Pc00119S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>IN CUSTODY: Srinivasan was arrested on

freedom,but also have no problem with the government monitoring their phone calls,emails and bank accounts.Blame it on a series of terror attacks across the country in the past few years,on growing fears that the Kashmir issue is spiralling out of control,or on perceptions that our neighbourhood is increasingly hostile,but a TOI-IMRB survey reveals huge insecurity among professional,young Indians in the metros.<br>The survey,conducted in Delhi,Mumbai,Kolkata,Chennai and Bangalore,reveals the startling extent to which young Indians associate their individual freedom with the might of the state.<br>Nearly 40% said the security forces were the true guarantors of rights and freedom and nearly 25% said it was the media,leaving only 7% to repose faith in politicians and 2% to believe in babudom.<br>On the question of what they considered the most significant attribute of freedom,the majority (28%) voted for the freedom to move freely and only 27% thought it was the freedom to vote in elections.The bad news is that the right to protest,which many other democratic societies might see as one of the most crucial aspects of freedom,ranked last from among the six choices.<br>The survey also reveals the conflict between new and old and the fact that lines seem to blur even in urban young India.While 58% people said the khap panchayats curb the freedom of individuals,a startling 30% saw them as protectors of our values and culture.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/1/Img/Pc00115S.jpg\"><br><font

Sector) Association (GIPSA),a body of non-life insurance public sector companies,decided on Saturday to invite expressions of interest to select a partner for all the TPA operations.<br>An official said: As of now,there are nearly 30 TPAs working with four public sector health insurance companies.Because of intense competition between them,the TPAs do not carry bargaining power when it comes to negotiating terms and conditions with hospitals.This will change once the new entity starts work. <br>The new entity is likely to start operations by June 30,2011,and will be incorporated as a TPA in accordance with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authoritys (IRDA) regulations.The move comes after a month of public sector health insurance companies refusing to provide cashless benefit for treatment in those hospitals that are not under the preferred provider network umbrella.<br><br><b>Related Articles</b><br><hr><a

It feels so good that I dont have to come back, I told them.Though the doctors were happy I had completed my treatment,they were quick to say, Dont forget to come for your review visits. <br>I had just finished radiotherapy after surgery and chemotherapy - seven months of treatment for breast cancer that had been diagnosed in July 2003.I felt like a survivor.<br>Every three months,I would go to the hospital for the review.Every time,the blood tests,xrays,ultrasounds and more would be gone through.Starting a week before the review,the heart beats would be faster,the nights would be spent without sleep.So it went,once in three months for the next five years,and then once in six months thereafter.The fifth and sixth year celebrations passed.No incident whatsoever.The last seven years have been absolutely normal.I have had a good life,except for lymphedema (swelling due to fluid retention) in the left hand.Even that is under control thanks to the lympha press machine,which is basically a massager that I have been using for six months.After seven years,you do get a feeling of having been cured.I kept reminding myself of what my oncologist once said, This illness is such that I am never able to tell my patients,you are cured and you do not have to come back for reviews. <br>One knows that with cancer you never know,and this was confirmed on May 15,2010.My six-month review was due in June and I decided to get the investigations done in May so that I could see the doctor in June.<br>I made the usual ride to the hospital and was there by 8.30am,empty stomach and all that.At the hospital,the usual queues,queries,filling of forms and waiting in line for my turn for the ultrasound.It was while I was on the bed for the ultrasound-abdomen test that the sprightly young radiologist murmured something about a target lesion in the liver.Oh my God! My heart missed a beat and did not beat normally for quite some time after.From the totally despondent thought that I would die in a few days to the dread of therapy to how it would affect my daughter to how expensive the treatment would be,the mind was racing in several directions but getting nowhere.The rest of that day passed in a haze.The immediate desire was to sit in a corner and cry,but the need to look dignified gets the better of you and I left the hospital stone-faced.In the car,it sank in deeper.I might have recurrent breast cancer in the liver,and where else I don't know.The ride back home was difficult.Things became a little better after sharing the news with immediate family but it was truly shattering.That day and the fortnight after was filled with a hectic schedule of investigations,consultations and concerned callers.By the tenth day,things became clearer.Yes,I have recurrent breast cancer in the liver and a few places in the bones.I was advised to undergo six cycles of chemotherapy.I was a lot more diffident than the last time,and the reasons were not hard to find.My father,a great source of emotional support,is no more.The huge motivation to see my daughter through her studies is no longer there as she is now happily employed.And finally,the capacity of my sevenyear-older body to take the battering of chemotherapy worried me.I did suggest to the family and the doctor that I be allowed not to take the treatment and to let the disease take its course.The family objected for obvious reasons.The doctor objected too,saying, Why should you give up When there is treatment available,we should give it a try. And so,I decided to take the treatment,give it my best shot and hope for the best.<b><br><br>(The writer currently works with the state government) </b><br><br><br><img

all.By the age of 33,he realised this dream,becoming the first person to walk to both the south and north poles.Since then,the polar explorer and environmentalist has been touring the world,raising awareness about the need to preserve Antarctica and promoting renewable energy use to combat climate change.<br>In 2041,the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty could be modified or amended, says Swan,who is in the city to give a series of talks.His mission is to inspire young people across the world,so that when they are leading the world in 2041,they will ensure that Antarctica will continue to be protected. <br>It was a film about Antarctica that inspired Swan,then a 11-year-old,to travel there.In 1979,after finishing university,he began raising money for his travel.I had to buy a ship and other materials to construct my home there, says Swan.In 1986,he sailed to Antarctica and began his walk to the south pole.<br>The 1,600 km walk took Swan and his team 70 days.We walked nine hours a day,seven days a week,pulling 180 kg on a sledge, says Swan.Our eyes hurt,faces burned,and skin peeled.Later,we realised that it happened while we walked under a hole in the ozone layer, says Swan,who has received an OBE and Polar medal from the queen of England.<br>In 1989,he walked to north pole.As we were walking across the frozen seas,1,000 km from land,ice caps started melting four months before they were supposed to, says Swan.We were witnessing first-hand the effects of climate change and global warming. <br>The two experiences,and the request of his patron,environmentalist Jacques Cousteau,inspired Swan to start 2041.I concentrate on reaching out to young people, says Swan,who takes young businessmen,women and journalists to see the impact of climate change on Antarctica.<br>Its time for India and China to avoid the mistakes the developed world made with the use and abuse of energy, says Swan.India can become the workshop of the world to create new clean technology, he says.<br>Swan,who has already toured Hyderabad,New Delhi and Kolkota,will be back in India in January 2011.I plan to identify a local environmental project,where I can involve people,just to show them you can achieve something, says Swan,who will be also bringing along 2041,the sailboat on which he has gone round the world on his Voyage for Cleaner Energy.Ill speak to schools,businesses and also identify someone whom I can take on my next trip to Antarctica, says Swan.<br>priya.menon@timesgroup.com <br><img

ordered in than homecooked.Everyone loves Chinese food,but people think its difficult to make because you need ingredients that you presume youll get only in China, says Anjan Chatterjee,CEO of Speciality Restaurants Limited,who is determined to change that with the launch of his The Mainland China Cookbook.<br>The book features 108 all-time favourite Chinese dishes and has been researched for over the 15 years since Chatterjees restaurant Mainland China was launched.It tries to make the cuisine relatively simple to cook at home.<br>We figured that if we could give them dishes that they can whip up at home,with ingredients and their locally available substitutes,it would make the cuisine accessible to Chinese food fanatics  the ones who can afford imported ingredients as well as those who want to experiment on a budget, says Anjan.Proceeds from the sale of the book (available at Mainland China restaurants and bookstores) will go toward an education fund for underprivileged children.<br>Its the reason why chef Rajesh Dubey of Mainland China,who worked with Anjan on the book,has added helpful hints to his recipes.For instance,how chilli oil can be made at home and how light soy sauce is more about flavour.Also,we have given vegetarian twists to non-vegetarian dishes because 40% of Indians who wants to cook Chinese are probably vegetarian, says chef Rajesh,who joined Anjan in the release of the book on Saturday.He adds that the book also busts certain myths about ingredients like how fish sauce does not contain any fish.We also have an entire section that details stores in different Indian cities that stock or can procure Chinese ingredients and condiments, he says.<br>R Mukundan of Steward International,one of the largest suppliers of Chinese condiments in the city,says that when he started his store it was mostly five-star Chinese restaurants that ordered from him.But a little over two years ago,that changed.I now get orders from five-star restaurants and even roadside food stalls that cook Chinese, he says.He now gets orders for condiments that he hasnt even heard of and does his own research to procure them.Earlier,it was the usual bottles of soy sauce and oyster sauce,now its the black and yellow bean sauces,the shitake mushrooms in vinegar,the raspberry cooking wine... the list goes on.Every week,I hear something newer and more unusual, adds Mukundan.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/2/Img/Pc00208S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>RIGHT DISH: Chef Rajesh Dubey cooks up

rockstar or actor to make an appearance,theyre waiting for the quizmaster.<br>For a while now,especially in Chennai,quizzing hasnt just been about nerds swotting all day in a library and being eager know-it-alls.And a large reason for its transformation from a memory test to a slick educational show is technology.The internet,laptops and other gadgets and gizmos have made quizzing more fun and challenging, says Dr Navin Jayakumar,an ophthalmologist and quizzer,who has been hosting the Landmark Quiz,one of the countrys largest open quizzes held every Independence Day,for over 15 years.Earlier,setting a quiz meant poring over 30 to 40 books and magazines.For an audio-visual quiz,we had to photograph the pictures from books,get them developed and mount them on slides.It was labourious, he says.Questions were written on sheets of fullscape paper.<br>They went to video shops to get audio and video clips recorded onto separate tapes.It would take about two hours to make a 15-second clip, says Gopal Kidao,who has been participating in and setting quizzes for 20 years.<br>Today,they just go to youtube.com to find the clips they want,surf the internet for information and pictures,put the whole lot onto a powerpoint presentation and take it to the venue.It takes about 100 hours of work to put together the Landmark quiz,but thats about half the time it took me earlier, says Jayakumar.<br>Chennai has been a centre for quizzing for years,but change has come in the last six years or so.Earlier,the quizzing scene was dominated by IITians and those who had access to the best libraries and books, says Rajen Prabhu,a management professional who is part of Quiz Foundation of India.He remembers how the three books from which quizzes were set would actually disappear from the IIT library at the beginning of the year.With the internet,anyone can be a quizzer, he says.<br>The audience too uses technology to its advantage.There are cases of people using mobile phones and handheld devices to look up answers on the internet during open quizzes, says Prabhu.Google even has voice search,so it can be quite hard to make sure people arent cheating when you have 300 to 400 people participating, he says.So quizmasters hit back by setting trickier questions.The questions are no longer straight, says Kidao.Youll have to reason out the answers with the knowledge you have.

Ravi | TNN </i></font><br><br><br>The sands of Elliots beach once again played host to the lilting notes of pure music.Lovers willingly gave way to music aficionados as Pandit Jasraj,clad in a green kurta,stepped out of his car at a quarter to seven.I love Chennaiites,they are such great listeners and so very knowledgeable, said the maestro.<br>However,his concert,on the inaugural day of Times Chennai Festival,attracted a global audience.Haruna and Akira,a Japanese couple,occupied seats just ahead of three Nigerians.In Tokyo we get his CDs and we are huge fans.I am very interested in what dialogue his vocals will have with the mridangam, said Haruna.<br>But serendipity also was very much at play.Subbulakshmi Patnaik and her young daughter Sanjana were at the beach for a walk but the sight of Jasraj sent them scrambling for tickets.Medical students Gautham and Krishna were jogging but decided to stay back,sitting beyond the roped off area,lit with electric bulbs placed in orange paper bags.<br>Those who planned well arrived even as the chairs were being arranged.Andal Rajagopal,a cancer patient,waited for his voice to do the magic and soothe the soul.The senior citizen,a trained Carnatic musician,said she last attended his concert years ago at IIT Kharagpur.<br>The jugalbandi between the north and the south was not lost on Pandit Jasraj either.I was 25 years old when I heard Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer in Kolkata,and Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan attended the spellbinding performance, recalled the renowned vocalist.MS Subbulakshmi and Rukmini Arundale loved my music. Just then,Tanvi,a blind 10-year-old stepped up to get his blessings.Moved,he took her face in his hands,blessed her,and the child,a student of Hindustani music,was happy beyond belief.<br>Was there a soul that did not dance in joy or find absolute peace as the Pandit gently serenaded the crowd with raag behag first His voice cruised smoothly across three-and-a-half octaves as the audience listened enrapt.His next number,a bhajan by Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya in mishrakapi,on Lord Krishna stealing butter and also the heart of Radha,had a section of the audience discussing many Tamil compositions describing the same episode.When Jasraj moved to the majestic raag dharbari to render the Adi Sankara number,bhaje bhaje kamandalam,the crowd settled back in their seats.Many closed their eyes,not paying attention to the Pandits repeated requests that the lights be turned on them.I want to see music in your eyes, he pleaded.<br>The audience,which surprisingly for Chennai has not thinned,merely drew back into the shadows,to better enjoy the music that lulls the torment of daily grind.A man stretched full length on the sand,closing his eyes.<br>After the Adi Sankara piece,Jasraj wanted to end the session.I am 80 years old and it is time to end, he said.The audience would have none of it.He obliged with a bhajan on Kali,visibly happy with the crowds response.Chennai is the only cultural city and it is a joy to perform here, said Jasraj,recalling the love and affection showered on him by Rukmini Arundale,MS and others.<br>All events and performances at The Times Chennai Festival are free.Cohosts for the event are Sheraton Park Hotel and Towers.<br>bhama.devi@timesgroup.com <br><img

Tambaram with a subway or a bridge,a road overbridge that will replace the existing railway crossing (LC No.29) near Tambaram Sanatorium will be inaugurated by state highways minister Vellakoil Saminathan on Sunday.<br>Workers of the city projects wing of the state highways department were busy giving final touches,including levelling a few patches on the pedestrian pathway along the bridge,on Saturday.One of the long-awaited and much-delayed project in the southern suburbs,the Rs 16-crore bridge is part of the gauge conversion project between Tambaram and Chennai Beach.After many hurdles,we were able to complete the project.The costs were equally shared by the state highways and Southern Railway, a highways department official told The Times of India.<br>The 820-metre long bridge is 8.5 metres wide,enough for two MTC buses to move side-by-side.With neatly laid ramps,the bridge is illuminated by 60 street lights and an equal number of reflectors on both sides.Channels have been built on either side of the bridge to discharge excess rain water into a collection pit beneath the bridge.For the benefit of commuters who need to reach the Tambaram Sanatorium railway station,Southern Railway has built a pedestrian underpass beneath the bridge.<br>Though the project was planned in 1999,work began only in December 2003 with an estimated cost of Rs 4.75 crore.Litigation,difficulty in land acquisition and demand by residents of the 12th ward of Tambaram municipality that additional ramps be built to connect the bridge with Bharatha Matha Street delayed the project,increasing the cost to Rs 16 crore.<br>The bridge has brought cheer to thousands of residents in Chitlapakkam,Pallavaram,Tambaram,Selaiyur and Chromepet.By replacing the existing level crossing,it will reduce the distance to the Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road by 3km.<br>The new bridge will provide a vital link between the two busiest stretches in the southern suburbs  the GST Road and Velachery Main Road.<br>madhavan.d@timesgroup.com <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/4/Img/Pc00410S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>MUCH-AWAITED

Up Anti-Colonial Sentiment <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Shalini Umachandran | TNN </i></font><br><br>Chennai: Acting and theatrics have always generated a buzz,drawn controversy and whipped up passions in Tamil Nadu.The lines often blur between film and politics  and its a trend that can probably be traced back to the days of the freedom struggle.<br>Back in the 1920s and 30s,travelling drama companies,whose performances often stretched as long as eight hours and were peppered with songs,staged shows that either openly called for people to join the freedom struggle or used allegory to draw people in.<br>Drama was used for propaganda in those days.And the event that stirred actors and writers to make the freedom struggle their theme was the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, says film historian Theodore Baskaran,author of Message Bearers: Entertainment,Media and National Politics.Until then,drama was only a form of popular entertainment. <br>Songs were a large part of theatre,and many of these about freedom acquired a life of their own beyond the stage.Its tough to imagine the magnitude of the freedom struggle.It moved into popular forms of discussion in various ways,one of them being theatre, says theatre activist Mangai.<br>Critic Sadanand Menon says Tamil theatre wasnt entirely about opposing the British.<br>The Dravidian movement had started by 1924 and the idea of Tamil nationalism was stronger, he says.Bengali,Marathi,Punjabi and Hindi theatre was extremely critical of the British Raj.<br>Between 1860 and 1880,the political theatre scene was extremely strong in the rest of the country.Neeldarpan,a Bengali play,in 1860,sparked off this phase.Theatre mobilised thousands to join the freedom struggle, he says.It probably didnt reach this magnitude in Tamil Nadu,but then,we cant be too sure of what did happen as there is very little documentation, he says.<br>Mangai agrees saying that drama notices are one of the few ways of knowing what plays were really about.But even those have all not been preserved and often plays were just announced by a man with a drum, she says.<br>The Dramatic Performances Act of 1876,the first act to introduce censorship in India,probably made playwrights choose a safer line.The fiery plays of the late 1800s led the British to introduce this draconian act, says Menon.So playwrights turned to allegory and analogy.The themes would be mythological or Puranic,but there would be a subtext about the freedom struggle, says Baskaran.When cinema came in the 30s,many actors moved from the stage to the screen.And this influence of drama made cinema extremely political as well, he says.<br>This was the first intersection of entertainment and politics,a trend that continues to this day.<br>KB Sundarambal,who started as a stage actor in plays about freedom,was the first woman to enter the legislature in 1958, says Baskaran.shalini.umachandran1@timesgroup.com <br><img

equipment as part of their modernisation drive has finally borne fruit.The Union home ministry has released Rs 93.85 lakh for 2009-10 to enable the purchase of mobile data retrieval systems,computer data retrieval systems,face and finger print recognition search management systems,global positioning systems and speed dome cameras.However,this year too,no fund allocation has been made.<br>Highly-placed sources in the department said the fund had been passed and the process for procurement of the equipment had begun.It has been a struggle to get funding for purchase of the equipment.On several occasions,our request for purchase of weapons and equipment had been denied, a senior official said.<br>However,the police believe it is better late than never and now plan to make the maximum out of the allocated funds.The mobile data retrieval system would be of great help in crime investigation as they will allow us to retrieve entire data from seized mobile phones,including those that are password protected or concealed.Similarly,the computer data retrieval systems can retrieve all information from the hard disc of a computer.The face and fingerprint recognition search management system would help police personnel profile the criminals and also cross check the voluminous data on profound offenders in our central server, the official added.<br>Once a fingerprint or a face is uploaded,the new system can in no time search through the entire database and throw up the matches,making it easier for the police to zero in on the accused.Two such systems are to be procured at a cost of Rs 3 lakh each.From the available fund,the police will also purchase 20-odd global positioning systems (GPS) for Rs 2.75 lakh and eight speed dome cameras,which would have a 360-degree field of vision,for Rs 24 lakh.The allocation of Rs 93.85 lakh also includes provisions for building up police infrastructure.Recently,city police commissioner T Rajendran had said that they would like to have cameras installed at all important areas in the city.The city police had already started installing cameras in many places of public gathering as a security measure.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/5/Img/Pc00515S.jpg\"><br><font

<br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>TIMES NEWS NETWORK </i></font><br><br>Tiruchi: Taunting the ruling DMK with the possibility of weaning the Congress away from its fold,AIADMK general secretary J Jayalalithaa on Saturday dropped a pregnant hint about her hope to team up with the national party in the assembly elections.<br>Though she refrained from making any overt remarks about electoral alliances in her blistering anti-DMK speech at a massive rally that brought Tiruchi city to a standstill,Jayalalithaa punned on the word hand,the symbol of the Congress,to convey her desire.The time has come to join hands ( kai korthu in Tamil) to put an end to the DMK government, she said,stressing on the word hand as she spoke.Later,copies of her speech given to the media had the word kai (hand) in single quotes.And she also did not forget to emphathise with sections of the Congress that is unhappy over being denied a share in power in Tamil Nadu,saying,Karunanidhi is not generous enough to include the Congress in the Cabinet. <br>Her indicative remark comes at a time when there are misgivings in the DMK about the salvos fired at the ruling party by former TNCC chief EVKS Elangovan.However,his appears to be an isolated voice so far,and there is as yet no sign that the Congress leadership is planning any review of its ties with the DMK,a loyal ally for the last six years.It is nevertheless seeking to strengthen its case for a hard bargain in seat-sharing talks.<br>In her address,marked by caustic barbs against the chief minister,she accused him of deceiving the people of Tamil Nadu by not fighting for the states riparian rights in the Cauvery water dispute with Karnataka.Karunanidhi has repeatedly failed to uphold the rights of Tamil Nadu farmers,forcing many of them to give up agriculture, she said and claimed that areas irrigated by the Cauvery had almost turned into desert due to shortage of water.<br>The huge gathering in Tiruchi sparked comparison with the attendance at her rally in Coimbatore last month,and the DMK can be expected to try and match it at its own rally here next month.The two parties had held such tit-fortat rallies in Coimbatore recently,as their turf battle unfolds region by region in the run-up to assembly elections.<br>Jayalalithaa said Karunanidhi failed to stop Karnataka from building dams to store Cauvery water before their inter-state accord was about to expire in 1974.In contrast,he spoke in the assembly in 1970 that Tamil Nadu has no objection to the building of the Hemavathi dam, she charged.<br>In 1972,he withdrew the states case before the Supreme Court case and also failed to renew the water accord with Karnataka.She claimed credit for the publication of the Cauvery tribunals interim order in the central government gazette and charged the DMK government with taking no effort to get the final order of 2007 gazetted by the Centre.<br>It was only after I announced the Tiruchi protest that Karunanidhi wrote a letter to his Karnataka counterpart seeking release of Cauvery water, she claimed.<br>She targeted the DMK regime for inability to control prices and the power shortage,blaming the latter on poor maintenance of power stations and purchase of substandard coal.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/6/Img/Pc00622S.jpg\"><br><font

employees  had raided a farm in Meenakshipuram near Sivakasi last Tuesday.Fuse material meant to be used as wicks in fireworks exploded when they tried to dispose it off and all eight officials standing near the seized explosives suffered serious burns.<br>Explaining the fatalities,doctors who treated the patients say they knew it was going to be difficult to save them as soon as they saw the nature of the injuries.The eighth victim to succumb at the Apollo Specialty Hospitals in Madurai was R Rajmohan,revenue inspector of Nalli.<br>All of them except village administrative officer R Kumarasamy,the first person to die of burns,and police inspector Abdul Latheef,who died on Friday,suffered more than 75% burns,according to hospital sources.Kumarasamy had only 56% burns,but he could not be saved as he suffered deep facial injuries  he was the one who lit the fuse that exploded.Moreover,he was a diabetes patient.Abdul Latheef had suffered 60% burns.Rajmohan had 90% burns,while Chandrasekaran,a revenue inspector who died on Thursday,was the worst sufferer with 96.5% burns.<br>Speaking to The Times of India,Dr Sam C Bose,senior consultant of plastic surgery,Apollo Speciality

to be 50ml/hr.In India,even burns above 50% are considered critical and pose a challenge to the doctors,he said.<br>After 24 hours,the doctors start concentrating on the other functions,like

repeating the folly of throwing in the towel in the face of mounting demands on the street for his dismissal amid mounting evidence of an administrative collapse.<br>Sources close to the CMs office said that Omar Abdullah was so angry on Friday after the killing of four more protesters by security forces that he was hell-bent on giving in his resignation.But he decided against rushing to Raj Bhawan after a chat with Farooq Abdullah.Farooq,who is the National Conference patron and Union renewable energy minister,assured his son that he still enjoyed the backing of the Congress Central leadership and that the Congress brass didnt want him to step down.<br>The pressure on Omar Abdullah seems to be telling.In his meetings with central leaders,he has more than once expressed his desire to quit if that helps matters.He said so again when he was here last week for the meeting of all political parties from J&amp;K with the PM.The CM also doubts whether Congresss support for him has ebbed.In his meeting with the members of the Cabinet Committee on Security,he asked whether they have any other plan.Omar was assured that Congress does not intend to push for his being replaced.<br>After violence erupted afresh on Friday,taking the toll in the recent spate to 56 and the moderates among the Hurriyat rejecting the PMs talks offer,the Congress core group,headed by party president Sonia Gandhi,met on Friday to discuss the Kashmir situation.It was at this meeting that Congress leaders felt that Farooq Abdullah should travel to Srinagar to boost his sons confidence,PMO sources said.<br>Congress does not want to take over the leadership of the coalition and has taken the view that who heads the coalition is National Conferences internal matter.In a fit of rage,Omar on Friday had also called off a scheduled meeting of the Unified Command of various security agencies.Officials,however,said heads of the security agencies were too busy with law and

local government agencies handling the oil spill off Mumbais coast,saying the massive destruction could have been mitigated if the agencies had proper equipment and expertise in handling pollutants.<br>TOI on Saturday morning accompanied Ramesh on his survey of the mangrove stretches affected by the oil spill at Elephanta near the tilting hulk of M S Chitra,the ship that collided with M V Khalijia 3 last Saturday.<br>Ramesh said India had never had an oil spill of such magnitude and observed that the pollutants had spread deep into the mangroves.The polluter will have to pay for the damages caused to the marine ecosystem but the compensation figure can be calculated only after conducting a comprehensive study on the adverse impact on mangroves,marine life and coastal fishing communities.The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Nagpur) and the National Institute of Oceanography (Goa) will study the impact and submit a report soon, Ramesh said.<br>After the survey,the minister had a good word only for the Coast Guard.He applauded the agency for responding immediately and rushing to the spot to begin rescue and salvage operations and plugging the spill to a great extent.The National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCP) of 2006 gives the Coast Guard the mandate to coordinate with local port authorities and state environmental agencies to assist in cleaning-up operations in case of massive oil spills, Ramesh said.<br>But that contingency plan also mandated agencies like the port trusts to have tier-1 (basic) facilities and they should have procured basic emergency response equipment like to minimise the impact of oil spills.But MbPT does not have these facilities and could not assist the Coast Guard,which resulted in the massive oil spill spreading to the shore, he said.<br>Chastened,a senior MbPT official said on Saturday that an MoU for getting tier-1 facilities would be signed shortly.We have learnt many hard lessons from this oil spill and will be better prepared for a disaster like this next time, he added.<br>The Bombay Natural History Societys (BNHS) first assessment after studying the oil spills impact on mangroves is that over 300 hectares of large patches of verdant mangroves on a 100-km stretch of the coastline have been completely destroyed.It will take at least one year to two years for them to regenerate and we will have to wait for the next seeding season to see whether the mudflats still have the oil slick, BNHS marine scientist Deepak Apte said.He said it was best to leave the mangroves alone with minimum human intervention.<br>State environment minister Suresh Shetty,who accompanied Ramesh,confirmed that a 25-km stretch of mangroves along a 100-km belt had been completely destroyed.<br>An FIR has been lodged against the owners of the two ships under the Environment Protection Act and the state would press for claims for the cleaning-up operation,the damage to the eco-system and the loss of livelihood for coastal communities.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/8/Img/Pc00811S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>EASY PREY: Union minister for environment

appeared a mellow man and said he would not resist the move.The Bangalore police have been camping in Kollam since August 10 with an arrest warrant in the name of the PDP leader whose anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the Karnataka high court.Madani has now approached the Supreme Court seeking anticipatory bail.<br>The PDP leader had termed the case as a conspiracy by the Karnataka police and Central intelligence agencies to target him.<br>The arrest had become a matter of ego between the two states as Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan claimed that the Bangalore police had arrived with the arrest warrant without alerting him or the state DGP.On Friday,Karnataka home minister rang up Balakrishnan and the matter was sorted out.<br>Sources say the Kerala police were

the VIP lounge catering.Sources say M/s Agarwal was chosen as it had the lowest bid,much less than the Rs 150 per plate that IRCTC had offered earlier.<br>It will be a cold fixed plate that will be provided to the workforce,and not hot meals, added the official.<br>The latest RFP was floated after the earlier one was cancelled despite getting bids.Kalmadi had claimed that with the bill for the

categorisation for 75% children will mean that if there is a school for army children,only children of army personnel can apply but there will be no test for them and admission will be through a

need for concern.<br>He said the tightening of the monetary policy by the central bank may not lead to interest rate going up as they have been well adjusted by the banks.Banks have taken note of it and adjusted accordingly, Mukherjee told reporters.In July,the RBI had hiked its lending rate (repo rate) and reverse repo rate to contain inflation.The short-term borrowing (reverse repo) rate was raised by 50 basis points and lending (repo) rate by 25 basis points.<br>However,Mukherjees optimism was not shared by several PSU banks.After meeting with the FM,SBI chairman O P Bhatt said though an upward bias on interest rates would be there,the hikes would depend from sector to sector and vary from bank to bank as per their liquidity situation.<br>Bhatt felt the rise may remain within an 1% range.Most of the banks have so far raised interest rates in the range of 25-50 basis points.The highest has been in the case of Punjab Nation Bank (PNB),to the extent of 75 basis points,Bhatt said,adding: So I would put hike in interest rates by PNB at the extreme end.It cannot be more than that. <br>After the RBI policy rate hikes,PNB had raised its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 75 basis points to 11.75%,while Bank of Baroda,Corporation Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce had increased it by 50 basis points each to 12.50%.The Union Bank and the IDBI upped their BPLR by 50

as excise duty,service tax,VAT,entertainment tax,luxury tax,etc.The new rates are expected to be 20% in the first year on standard goods against the prevailing 14.3%-24.3%.In the case of services,it is expected to be 16% against the current 10.3%.<br>According to a recent survey by KPMG in association with CII,around 88% of the respondents prefer a single national GST enactment.Nearly 200 senior executives across IT/ITES,pharma,FMCG and automotive industries,most of them with a pan-Indian presence,participated in the survey.Right now,there is a cascading effect of taxation when it comes to movement of goods between states, says TVS Motors managing director Venu Srinivasan.Adds KPMG executive director Sachin Menon,One of the anomalies of the present indirect tax structure is the multiplicity of tax rates as well as multiplicity of taxes at the centre and states. <br>Apart from impacting tax cost,GST is also likely to have an effect on working capital.In fact,46% of the respondents feel higher working capital maybe blocked under GST.GST works on the assumption that credit will be available through the entire supply chain, says LV Srinivasan,India tax director,AREVA T&amp;D India.<br>But GST is expected to have a positive impact on profitability of business operations as the full tax is borne by the final consumer.This ensures that tax will always be a pass through and never a part of the cost,thereby having a positive impact on profitability.But respondents from the services sector (like IT) did not feel so.Such providers are already enjoying the

conferred the Ashok Chakra,the countrys highest peacetime gallantry award.<br>Major Laishram Jyotin Singh,an Army doctor posted in Kabul,fought a heavilyarmed terrorist during an attack on Indians at a Kabul hotel on February 26.He gave up his life for the sake of his colleagues,one of whom unfortunately was still charred to death,and another succumbed to his injuries five days later.His sacrifice,in addition,also saved the lives of two officers,four paramedics and two Afghan civilians still alive within the compound, the defence ministry said on Saturday,while announcing the gallantry awards on the eve of Independence Day.<br>The 37-year-old doctor from Manipur showed exemplary courage when a heavily-armed terrorist,after detonating an explosives-laden vehicle,entered the hotel building.As he was firing from his AK rifle and lobbing grenades,Singh charged with bare hands and pinned the man down to ensure he could no longer lob grenades or fire at the officers cornered in a burning room, the statement said.<br>The Major grappled with the terrorist until the latter detonated his suicide vest.Both were killed instantly.<br>Kirti Chakra,the second highest peacetime gallantry award,has been given to Captain Davinder Singh Jass and Chhattisgarh Superintendent of Police Vinod Kumar Choubey (both posthumously).<br>Jass was given the award for counter-terrorist operations in Jammu.On February 23,when Jass was leading an operation in Chinkipur,his squad came under heavy terrorist fire.He evacuated two of his injured men to safety,but was injured, the MoD said.He carried on and closed in on hiding terrorists and killed one of them.He later succumbed to his injuries.<br>Vinod Kumar Chaubey will receive Kirti Chakra posthumously for anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh.On July 12,2009,when a police post in Rajnandangaon was attacked,he was rushing there but his carcade was ambushed by Naxalites.However,he reached the site where an encounter was on.Choubey carried out a surprise attack on Naxals.He was hurt but continued to fire and ultimately made the supreme sacrifice.<br>Besides Ashok Chakra and two Kirti Chakras,112 gallantry awards,including two Bar to Shaurya Chakras,19 Shaurya Chakras,two Bar to Sena Medal (Gallantry),80 Sena Medals (Gallantry),three Nao Sena Medals (Gallantry) and five Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry) have

provide brain power for the nation.<br>She asked the Naxalites to shun violence and join the mainstream and also urged the global community to work collectively to deny terrorists sanctuaries,training ground and financial support.<br>She lauded the security forces for their hardwork in guarding the frontiers and internal security.<br>Addressing the nation on the eve of 64th Independence Day,the President said the Right to Education has made free and compulsory primary education a fundamental right,which needs to be supplemented by a similar step towards the secondary education.<br>With RTE in place,the Presidents call may set the tone for revolutionising the education sector through another constitutional amendment.<br>Patil also called for a new green revolution.She said boosting the agriculture production,productivity and profitability is key to food security and price stabilisation.The concern over the price rise comes in the backdrop of a growing unrest among citizens over rising prices of food items and the attacks on the UPA government for failing to rein in prices.Patil said agriculture has to be linked to industry to help agri-business grow in rural areas.<br>The President took special note of an increasing emphasis on materialism,which has been leading to growing insensitivity in the society and to the weakening of family bonds.Social consciousness in on the decline.Some social evils persist.This must change, she said,in what appeared to be a remark aimed at the spurt in honour killings.<br>Amid protests in Kashmir and rising Naxal violence,Patil stressed a need for spirit of reconciliation,which she said could be fostered by choosing dialgoue as a channel for communication.The proponents of extreme ideologies and the followers of Left Wing extremism must abandon their path of violence.I call on them to join national efforts for growth and development, she said.<br>Vice-president Hamid Ansari urged all citizens to commit ourselves to make India a

hours,passengers would be provided with hotel accommodation.Directorate General of Civil Aviations Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) for  facilities to be provided to passengers  in all the three cases can be accessed on DGCAs website www.dgca.co.in.<br>If an airline is responsible for a flight delay of two hours or more,it would provide  food and refreshments  to the passengers.In case a flight is delayed for more than 24 hours,the airline would provide hotel accommodation to passengers.Whats bad news for passengers in this case is that the CAR does not differentiate between daytime and night-time flights.<br>So,if your 1am flight is inordinately delayed,the airline need not provide you with hotel accommodation for the night.You would have to stay in the airport terminal for the next 24 hours,that is till 1am the next day,after which the airline has to provide a hotel room.This would not apply in cases where delays are due to circumstances not in the hands of the airline.<br>

claims </b><br><br>Mumbai: A third party administrator to be floated by public sector health insurance companies is likely to come into force next year.<br>It is expected that 50-75 % of health insurance premium of General Insurance (Public Sector) Association (GIPSA) would be transferred to the new entity by its third year of operation and 75-100 % by the fifth year.But all this is subject to its performance,especially in terms of reduction in claims, an official explained.<br>The four public sector health insurance companies currently dominate with a collective market share of around 80% and recover premium in the region of Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 6,000 crore every year from policy holders.They started outsourcing the business to TPAs in 2002.<br>A GIPSA official said: With the mushrooming of TPAs,the claim ratio has gone up substantially,which is not to the liking of the health insurance industry.Many of these TPAs,with an eye on profit,are compromising their role by encouraging high claims as a few of them are hand-in-glove with some hospitals. <br>Another official said: Being an independent entity,the TPAs do not have a stake in ensuring higher profitability for the insurance companies.After the joint venture starts,there is likely to be huge a change in the way business is done.The GIPSA-TPA JV will be more responsible in controlling claims as it is going to have a direct effect on the bottomline of insurance companies. <br>Explaining the rationale behind the move,an official said: By controlling the TPA operations,GIPSA members aim to curb fraudulent claims.Moreover,GIPSA will not have to deal with multiple agencies to manage its business.Apart from cutting losses,the JV will also benefit customers as there will be better coordination between the insurance firms and this new TPA,which is a part of GIPSA.

carries Hussein as his middle name after his Muslim father,chose a White House Iftar dinner to announce his support for the project.<br>Let me be clear: as a citizen,and as president,I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country, Obama said at the event that has over the years become a signature White House showpiece for outreach to

issue engenders.Ground zero is,indeed,hallowed ground,'' he said.But,he argued,''the principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country,and will not be treated differently by their

watched the freighter slide into port.The arrival of the cargo ship and its 490 refugees,however,raised concerns among Canadian officials that the rebel Tamil Tigers were smuggling people into Canada,which is home to the largest Tamil community outside Sri Lanka and India.<br>Our goal is to ensure that our refugee system is not hijacked by criminals or terrorists, said the public safety minister,Vic Toews,whose government labeled the LTTE a terrorist group in 2006.<br>Last October,a ship carrying 76 Sri Lankans was intercepted in Canadian waters.All are free while their cases are being processed.While the war is over,Tamil leaders in Canada say that the ethnic Tamil minority still faces persecution in Sri Lanka.If people looked at what theyve endured back home,people would give these refugees the benefit of the doubt,which is what they do for every other person who approaches our borders, said a spokeswoman for the Canadian Tamil Congress.AGENCIES

FREE NATION THAT IS BOUND FAST BY FEAR","post":"Freedom WORK IN PROGRESS <br><b>A FREE NATION THAT IS BOUND FAST BY FEAR </b><br><br>They are free citizens of an independent country.But what do Indians think the word freedom really means <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>TIMES INSIGHT GROUP </i></font><br><br><br>In a telling indicator of our troubled times,India sees the security forces as the institution that safeguards our freedom the most.An opinion poll,conducted exclusively for the TOI on the eve of the 63rd an niversary of our independence,found that the media was seen as the next biggest safeguard of freedom,followed by the judiciary and civil society ac tivists.<br>Perhaps our politicians and bureau crats will be chastened to find that a mere 7% and 2% of respondents respec tively picked them as the institutions that safeguard Indias freedom.Or maybe it is too much to ask that they see the rebuff for what it is.<br>Another indicator of the extent to which Indians feel imperiled is the fact that 53% said the government should be allowed to monitor phone calls,bank ac counts and e-mail accounts and a further 19% said this should be allowed for a sus pect person.That left a mere 28% of In dians holding the opinion that such monitoring was an unacceptable intru sion into personal privacy.<br>But what exactly do Indians associate with the notion of freedom,63 years on Interestingly,the most popular response was the freedom to move freely,fol lowed by the freedom to vote in elections Clearly,the atmosphere in the sub-conti nent has played a role in determining this response.The right to protest which many other democratic societies might have seen as one of the most cru cial aspects of freedom,ranked last from among the six choices.<br>Isnt the right to raise your voice against wrongdoing by the system a key aspect of being a free country Yes said 45%,but 32% qualified the re sponse,saying such protest was right only up to a point.Another 21% took the my country,right or wrong approach.<br>A caveat is in order.The face-to-face survey was conducted in the countrys five biggest cities  Mumbai,New Del hi,Kolkata,Chennai and Bangalore  and restricted to a little over 500 people aged between 18 and 45 and from the top socio-economic category,SEC A.There fore,the opinion reflected here indicates the feelings of the relatively young,met ropolitan professional Indian.<br>That said,it is surprising that even in this group,opinion on the khap pan chayats stance on same-gotra marriages is far from unanimous.While 58% said that the khaps were curbing individual freedom,a sizeable 30% said they were protecting traditional values and culture and the remaining 12% had no clear opinion on the subject.<br>Another interesting finding was that barely five years after the RTI Act was passed and hailed as a revolutionary step in enhancing transparency and thereby,freedom,doubts are begin to surface.True,64% said Acts like this en hance our freedom.But almost one fourth of all respondents said it was mere tokenism and nearly one-tenth saw it as hindering the governments functioning.Would allowing gay mar riages be a step towards enhancing free dom The largest chunk,39%,said it would be a sign of perversion,not free dom.But,there were clear indicators of the growing acceptance of sexual diver sity with one-quarter of the respondents firmly in favour of legalizing gay mar riages and another quarter saying they were okay with it,even if it made them uncomfortable.<br>Is the special treatment meted out to Indian VIPs an anachronism in a free democratic society The answer is less vehemently in the affirmative than you might expect.While 60% said that it mil itated against the notion that every India was a free and equal citizen,a sizeable 38% said the preferential treatment was justified.<br>How do people view the many outfits  political,religious and others  that demand new states,special rights,mi nority status,more development in cer tain areas and so on About 43% ex pressed the view that this was just po litical tamasha and another 25% said they were effectively curtailing the free dom of the masses,leaving only 29% ex pressing the view that such outfits were important because minority voices must be heard.<br>On each of these questions,there was great diversity of opinion across cities In most cases,Chennai emerged as true to its reputation as a conservative city but there were interesting variations For instance,Chennai was most vocifer ous in its defence of the need to raise ones voice against the system when it indulges in wrongdoing.<br>Similarly,while Mumbai on the whole revealed liberal opinions,it was the most vehement about the security forces being the biggest safeguard of In dias freedom.<br>More than any other city,Delhi cham pioned the RTI as an empowering Act in a likely indication of how effectively ac tivists in the national capital have used the legislation.Kolkata was the most strongly opposed to the khap panchay ats views on same-gotra marriages,an indication perhaps that there,more than anywhere else,traditional social mark ers like caste have weakened consider ably.Bangalore was the only city to speak out strongly for gay marriages as a step towards enhanced freedom rather than as a perversion.<b><br><br>53% </b><br><br>say the

freedom to deal with <br>the rest of the world on the political and economic front without being held to ransom.For Naqvi,a free country offers people like him abundant professional and economic opportunity.I have not witnessed war or a major civil strife,I find it easier to use economic parameters to measure my freedom, he says.He concludes,But that does not make me less patriotic than my elders.I cherish belonging to a free state,though sometimes I may not fully realize how much I value it.

That means that if a cricket enthusiast uses the keyword lord on Google now,the search engine will use his search history and come up with information on Lords rather than the Almighty.On the other hand,for a person with a spiritual bent of mind,the result will be the opposite.<br>A smart search engine is just the beginning of better times.As more and more information goes online,Singhal envisages a future where it will be simply available when you need it.You wont have to look for it.You will not have to search.This is where we are heading, he says with the conviction of a man who has seen the fruition of his dreams over the last two decades.<br>Before then,search engines have to get past bottlenecks.To begin with,there is the real-time challenge.Despite its expertise,Google was caught unawares by Twitter and Facebook where information is generated and consumed in real-time.Real-time has been a major focus in the last few years and we have improved a lot with Caffeine, claims Singhal,demonstrating the way the Updates feature on the Google homepage tracks tweets in real-time.<b><br><br>HANDY CELLPHONES </b><br><br>Search engines also need to work on the search beyond text option,though they have managed to crack search through voice and image on the smartphone.One brand of smartphones allows a tourist,for example,to simply point the instrument at the Taj Mahal and get information on the monument from the web.<br>Smartphones are a key element in Singhals futuristic world.Its a world where we wont encounter the science of search on some webpage but in our daily lives.I am incredibly excited about the search without searching,a device like cellphones that will take over the work of looking for information. <br>He offers an example.You want to buy a cricket bat and you put it on your to-do list.So,your phone knows about it.It also knows which route you take to commute from office to home because you use GPS navigation built into it.Using local business listings,it knows that several shops on the route sell cricket bats.I imagine a future when you will get a prompt from your phone telling you to buy the bat just when you are near the concerned shop, he says.Thats the future  when we wont have to look for information.It will be available everywhere just at the moment when you need it. <b><br><br>WANDERING THE WEB </b><br><br><b><br><br>1990:

BRIGHTER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT","post":"OFF THE SHELF <br><b>THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT </b><br><br>Partition literature has largely confined itself to the bloodshed that took place during the 1947 riots.But there are many good news stories that need to be told <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Tridivesh Singh Maini </i></font><br><br><br>There were instances of Muslims rescuing Hindus and vice versa at great risk to themselves.Sociologist Ashis Nandy says these account for at least 25% to 30% of all those who were saved from death at the hands of a mob.This is no exaggeration.The positive stories have largely remained untold.They were obscured by the larger tension and hatred.<br>Professor Mushirul Hasan,historian and former vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia University,was one of the first to highlight such stories,especially the one about Khushdeva Singh,a Sikh doctor,who rescued many Muslims.So has Urvashi Butalia in The Other Side of Silence and Yasmin Khan in The Great Divide.<br>A recent Ford Foundation project by Nandy and Rajmohan Gandhi stands out as something that specifically deals with the humane side of Partition and is helping the process of reconciliation begin.Its aim is to document the experiences of survivors.Some of their findings are revealing.<br>First,the religious preacher would often save individuals belonging to the other community.This might come as something of a surprise because faith has long been presented as the main cause of Partition and the bloodshed that followed.But,religious shrines were used to hide people and generally,it was women and children who were saved.<br>Some survivors had remarkable stories to tell,not least the one about a senior Muslim politician who sent his Muslim servants to escort his non-Muslim friends to a camp.The servants killed some of their masters friends.The politician murdered his servants when he learnt of their betrayal.This episode underlines the way values such as friendship and honour shone through the violence of Partition.Till now,Partition literature spoke reams about revenge and attacks by one community on the other,but it seldom mentioned the other human emotions on display.<br>For instance,a Muslim family migrating from Amritsar to Lahore,took with them two Sikh girls whose father was abroad at the time.Taking the girls along was a perilous thing to do in the circumstances.But the upshot was that they were saved and later returned to Amritsar.<br>Fahmeeda Bano,widow of Muhammad Yahsin,who rescued the girls,reminisces,We thought that these young girls should not be left alone.We took them as a part of our family  as our own children.So we all came to Pakistan.However,on our way to Lahore,we saw several dead bodies by the railway track.Finally,when we reached Lahore,they stayed with our family for two months.In October 1947,when the tense atmosphere of killing and violence abated,my husband went back to India with them.Without much difficulty,the girls were reunited with their father. <br>Banos son,Awais Sheikh,heads an NGO,Pak-India Peace Initiatives,and represents Sarabjit Singh,the Indian who has been in prison in Pakistan for two decades.<br>Parkash Tandon,businessman and writer,says that until August 14,1947,many non-Muslims were not sure they would have to migrate to India.In fact,they unfurled the flag of Pakistan.Research reveals that some Sikhs too unfurled the Pakistani flag.<br>Oral history has been critical in piecing together individual experiences of the other side of a cataclysmic and traumatic event.<b><br><br>The writer collaborated on a crossborder book about Partition </b><br><br><br><img

freedom was born with hunger, were still not free","post":"FOR THE RECORD <br><b>Our freedom was born with hunger,were still not free </b><br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>M S SWAMINATHAN </i></font><br><br>On August 15,1947,22-year-old Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan famously headed for Auroville even as almost everyone else in Madras seemed to be bound for Marina Beach to celebrate the birth of a free India.Later,he would choose to study agriculture rather than medicine,rightly judging that plentiful food production had an important role to play in keeping a country independent.He went on to play a leading role in Indias Green Revolution of the 1960s.In 1999,he was one of only three Indians to be on TIME magazines list of the 20th centurys 20 most influential Asians.The other two were Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi.Swaminathan,85,was in the capital recently and spoke to Saira Kurup about Indias many revolutions  those past and still to come.<b><br><br>Its 63 years since India became independent.But we are still fighting for freedom from hunger and poverty.Is this a battle we might never win </b><br><br>Our freedom was born with hunger.It was born in the backdrop of the Bengal famine.If you read the newspapers dated August 15,1947,one part was about freedom,the other was food shortage.This is why Jawaharlal Nehru said after Independence that everything else can wait but not agriculture.<br>The battle against hunger is a battle we have to win.It requires a fusion of political will,professional skill and peoples participation.Our country is fortunate to have fairly good water resources,reasonably good rainfall,a hardworking farming population.We must bring about a marriage between brain and brawn in rural professions.We need a large number of educated young people to go into farming using science and new eco-technologies.We have all the necessary ingredients for progress.But the gap between scientific knowhow and field level do-how is large.<br>The green revolution was the product of four things: the first was technology.The genetic technology of the 1960s was transformational and changed peoples understanding of wheat and rice yields.The second was services that took the technology to the field like extension services,credit and insurance;third was public policies of inputoutput pricing like the prices commission,and lastly,the farmers enthusiasm.Today,unfortunately,the most important thing is missing  farmers enthusiasm.A revolution cannot come from a government programme.A National Sample Survey study says 40% of the farmers want to leave farming.Its important to revive that enthusiasm.<b><br><br>Theres no shortage of food in terms of production.Why are people going hungry then </b><br><br>There are three parts to the problem.First,availability of food in the market,which is not bad;second,access to food or purchasing power.Under NREGA,a worker gets Rs 100 a day for 100 days i.e Rs 10,000 a year.If he has a family of five,it means Rs 2,000 a year per person.When dal is selling at Rs 80 to Rs 90 a kilo,how do they buy it Third,is the absorption of food in the body,which means getting clean drinking water,sanitation.Otherwise,it means a leaky pot  a child would keep getting infections.<b><br><br>How do you view the green revolution now,when the widespread use of pesticides in Punjab is being linked to increase in cancer rates in some areas </b><br><br>In 1966,I had said the green revolution should be an evergreen revolution,which is enhancement of productivity in perpetuity without ecological harm.I had warned against overuse of pesticides and fertilizers and against converting the green revolution into a greed revolution.<b><br><br>What can be done to set things right </b><br><br>There are two aspects of the green revolution  farm ecology and farm economy.But if farm ecology goes wrong,nothing else will go right.Soil quality must be taken care of,water quality must be ensured.We should also be ready for climate change.I call it a two-pronged strategy  get the best of a good monsoon or climate and second,minimize the adverse impact of unfavourable weather.<b><br><br>Why are you objecting to Bt brinjal </b><br><br>I didnt oppose it.I supported Jairam Rameshs moratorium.I chaired a committee in 2004 and recommended in a report the setting up of a regulatory authority,which would have its own testing facilities.The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee has no such facility.I advocate safe and responsible use of biotechnology particularly in the case of human nutrition.Some long-term residual toxicity tests should be done.If you introduce some good-yielding hybrids,farmers will grow only those.So I said,Use the moratorium to collect all the genetic material or germ plasm. We also need a literacy programme for the public.<b><br><br>You have been influenced by the philosophy of the Mahatma and Sri Aurobindo.In an age when technology is the new god,do you think there can be a meeting point for science and spirituality </b><br><br>There can be no science without spirituality.It gives purpose to science.Vivekananda said,This life is short,the vanities of the world are transient,but they alone live who live for others. Thats my personal philosophy.My father was a doctor.He died when I was 10.My mother wanted me to go into medicine.But the papers were full of Bengal famine and I asked myself how I could serve my country better.I got calls from a medical college and an agricultural college.After I joined,the principal of the agricultural college asked me why I took up agriculture because the subject was not considered as important as medicine! <b><br><br>Do you have any unfulfilled dreams </b><br><br>My only dream is a hunger-free India.Every fourth child here is born underweight.We are denying our own children opportunities for a fulfilled life.I wanted to see a hunger-free India in 2007 when we celebrated our 50th year of Independence.But it has not happened.Thats why I accepted nomination to the Rajya Sabha because in a democratic country much depends on the political system.Fortunately,when I was Farmers Commission chairman,we recommended a food guarantee Act.Now I am in the National Advisory Council and am working on the Right to Food Act.Its the last chance to make food a legal right.Gandhiji said in Noakhali in 1946 that the first and foremost duty of independent India is to see that no ch i l d,woman or man should go to bed hungry,because to the hungry,bread is god.<br><img

lesson: jaw-jaw, not war-war","post":"OUT OF TURN <br><b>Historys lesson: jaw-jaw,not war-war </b><br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>M J AKBAR </i></font><br><br>Would we remember August 15 if it were not a holiday Admit it: most of us are feeling vaguely cheated that it falls on a Sunday this year.Its rituals have fallen flat,tripped by boredom and repetition.<br>A more interesting question: did we actually become independent on August 15,1947 No.This truth has been carefully screened behind a mist of sentiment and the symbolism of the rising tricolour on a pole where once flew the Union Jack.What we got in 1947 was dominion status,under the Government of India Act of 1935,amended by the British Parliament in 1947 to create two dominions instead of one.At the apex of their polity,India and Pakistan would have a governor general,appointed by the British monarch in consultation with Delhi and Karachi.<br>Jawaharlal Nehru,with commendable foresight,asked the last viceroy,Mountbatten,to continue,and gave him a role in the executive as chairman of the Cabinets defence committee.This was hard-headed,not sentimental,since the commanders of the Indian armed services were British,as were senior officers: transition would take time.This single decision would pay historic dividends in Jammu and Kashmir.Mountbatten wanted to be named governor general of Pakistan as well,but Jinnah chose to become Pakistans first British appointment,rather than his countrys first prime minister.<br>India became a sovereign nation on January 26,1950 when it adopted a Constitution and held an election that gave India its first adult franchise government.In Pakistan,there was much squalid politics,with governments being dismissed arbitrarily,before it got a Constitution in 1956,soon usurped by a military coup.Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy,united Bengals last premier and the law minister who piloted the Constitution through the assembly,tells an amusing story in his memoirs.In May 1953,Governor General Ghulam Mohammad,dismissed Pakistans first Bengali prime minister,Khwaja Nazimuddin,just after he had proved his majority in the legislature,apparently because Nazimuddin was about to reduce the strength of the army by 30,000 men.Ghulam Mohammad took care to cut Nazimuddins telephone line to prevent him from appealing to Queen Elizabeth for a reversal of the dismissal.Such action would have been within her legal rights.<br>Do these anachronisms of history matter <br>They matter so much that blood is still being spilt in Jammu and Kashmir.<br>Partition divided India and Pakistan in 1947,but did not resolve the status of the two largest princely states,Kashmir and Hyderabad.The Hindu maharaja of Muslim-majority Kashmir and the Muslim Nizam of Hindu-majority Hyderabad thought,for reasons they never made very clear,that they could remain independent.A little after Partition,Nehru wrote to Mountbatten that the best time for discussions on the future of Kashmir would be after the spring thaw of 1948 since his government was overburdened by the bitter aftermath of riots and resettlement.<br>Pakistan pre-empted a peaceful settlement in 1948 by organizing an invasion thinly disguised as an uprising,in October 1946.If Pakistan had not sought to seize Kashmir through war,the Kashmir problem would have been resolved across a table in 1948.The Act granting dominion status to India and Pakistan did not envisage independence for any princely state.Britain still had a legitimate presence on the subcontinent.<br>Mountbatten,as governor general,and Nehru,as prime minister,did not let Pakistan seize by armed force what should have been negotiated over a table.They ensured the legality of the Indian response to aggression through the instrument of accession and then supervised the Indian Army action that drove the invaders out of most of Kashmir.<br>When,in response,Jinnah ordered the Pakistan army to join the war,he discovered the limitations of his power in a dominion.Acting chief of the Pakistan army,General Sir Douglas Gracey refused to take orders from Jinnah.His army joined the war only in the spring of 1948,after a quiet nod from London.<br>Mountbatten was,of course,also the man who pushed Nehru into referring Kashmir to the United Nations.It is ironical that his reputation is now stained on both sides of the border.In Pakistan,he is vilified as the biased viceroy who favoured Nehrus India for public and personal reasons;in India,he is the UN-villain.Such was the fate of do-gooders whose best intentions were a trifle out of step with reality.The Kashmir story has now moved beyond the UN,plebiscites and even the India-Pakistan war.War solved nothing and wrought nothing but misery in 1947;it can only inflict havoc today.There is only one lesson,if indeed anyone has time for historys moral science.The war that Pakistan began is a recipe for disaster;the negotiations that Nehru and Mountbatten wanted are still the only option.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/16/Img/Pc01611S.jpg\"><br><font

is our most precious resource","post":"SWAMINOMICS <br><b>Jugaad is our most precious resource </b><br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>SWAMINATHAN S ANKLESARIA AIYAR </i></font><br><br>People ask me,what exactly is jugaad Global management experts attribute Indias rapid economic growth to jugaad.In a recent survey by the Legatum Institute,81% of Indian businessmen said jugaad was the key reason for their success.<br>Many years ago,innovative Punjabis mounted a diesel irrigation pump on a steel frame with wheels,creating a vehicle they called jugaad.It was ultra-cheap but did not conform to vehicular regulations.Over time,jugaad came to mean grassroots innovation to overcome any constraint.<br>In the West,innovation is done by scientists using expensive equipment.In India,its done by every housewife,farmer,transporter,trader and industrialist.It does not require high-spending R&amp;D : it simply needs creativity and imagination.Anil Ambani once said Reliance succeeded through innovation,not invention.<br>One avatar of jugaad is what management gurus call frugal engineering,exemplified in the Tata Nano,the cheapest car in the world.Indias telecom companies provide calls at Re 1 a minute,the cheapest in the world.Narayana Hrudayalaya and Shankara Nethralaya provide the cheapest heart and eye treatment in the world.Indian reverse-engineering of patented drugs is also frugal engineering.<br>Some management experts warn that jugaad uses any means,legal or illegal,to get a job done.They say bribery and manipulation must not be confused with genuine creativity.<br>I disagree.The creativity in unethical activity is,with rare exceptions,not fundamentally different from the creativity that yields frugal engineering.The incentives and rewards of the political-economic system determine whether creativity is used mainly for unethical profit or heroic productivity.<br>The hawala market,for instance,is used by drug lords for money laundering.But it is also an example of jugaad,enabling poor migrants to remit money across countries,faster and more cheaply than any formal bank system.Hawala was legal for centuries before modern governments declared it illegal.<br>Dhirubhai Ambani was the master of jugaad.The licencepermit raj made it impossible for him to progress legally,so he exploited the corruption and cynicism of the system.<br>He exported junk to get profitable import entitlements.He created industrial capacities vastly in excess of licensed capacity.He imported huge textile machines as spare parts.He engineered highly profitable changes in rules for polyester imports and telecom licences.The jugaad he used to overcome hurdles was not distinguishable from crony capitalism.<br>Yet when the licence-permit <br><img

Fort ritual symbolizes state sovereignty","post":"MATTERS OF STATE <br><b>Red Fort ritual symbolizes state sovereignty </b><br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>SHIV VISVANATHAN </i></font><br><br>Childhood memories of politics had two markers in terms of the state.The first was Republic Day,which was a carnival of the state,a day when the state created a sense of itself as spectacle.As a child,one did not see it.All one heard was the commentary on radio.It was slow,tedious,pompous,impressive;a verbal articulation of the dreams of a nation and a republic.It was the costume ball of the nation like a great fancy dress,each tableau articulating a social contract between people,security,sovereignty and development.<br>The second event was much more sombre.It had a different dignity to it.If Republic Day was staged in Lutyens Delhi,Independence Day was at the Red Fort.It had a different dignity to it,a different ritual quality.One realized that both events were staged representations of the state.But the backdrops provided different variants of symbolism.One imitated the pomp and carnival of colonial rule,the other the monumentality of the Mughal regimes.The Red Fort or Lal Qila as a backdrop provided the magic and monumentality of the state.<br>August 15 was the province of the PM.It was here that Nehru gave his tryst with destiny  speech.If Republic Day was replete with the visuality of jets,horses and tanks,Independence Day articulated itself as memory,as trusteeship.Between the two events,ones loyalty to the state as nation and the nation state was complete.<br>The reclaiming of the Red Fort as a symbol was convenient.The colonial regime found forts cumbersome.They used it as barracks.The fort as a symbol had shrunk.After Independence,the ceremonial of August 15 reclaimed Lal Qila for the state.It became symbolic of the state,visualized as large,capacious and monumental,a symbol of bounded security and sovereignty.It evoked permanence.<br>It was hard not to love the pomp and splendor of the state.Growing older,the backdrop acquired a different meaning.During the Emergency,The Lal Qila was a torture cell for interrogation.One suddenly felt that the state itself was a cordon sanitaire that kept civil society apart.The Lal Qila was the formal state,Chandni Chowk as the bazaar was civil society.<br>Independence Day as an event was quicker,more political.Soon the prospect of terrorism loomed around it and the VIPs appeared even more distant.It was as if the state and its symbols were changing.A stray dog running across the Republic Day parade seemed more symbolic of freedom than all the panoply of tanks and soldiers.<br>One had to wonder if one was acquiring a sense of remoteness and distance.Was the living historicity,the gigantic monumentality of the Red Fort evocative of the tangibility of the state turning into a cardboard backdrop Was skepticism about the state being reflected in the shrinking symbolism of history <br>One had to ask oneself if the state itself was necessary.Did these bits of drama add magic to the emptiness of the state Did the ritual at the Red Fort renew the nation as a social contract It is important to realize the power of ritual.<br>The performers might be weak,the leader might be effete;even a man one would not vote for.Yet,on that day,he appears larger than life.The Red Fort gave a sense of tangibility,or permanence that the politician as an ephemeral creature could not provide.One realized that the performance was a role.The performance of the prime minister could be weak but the ritual drama goes on.The state renews itself in cyclical time.<br>The Red Fort,opened out as a canvas,becomes a reworked state.The reciprocity is  Lal Qila to Chandni Chowk,state to civil society.The canvas gets reinterpreted as text and context get woven into a new interpretation of the state.The text of the speech seemed irrelevant.All one needed were words as a primordial bond,evoking a promissory note between state and society.The symbolism of Independence Day was reworked every time.In a Durkheimian sense,ritual replayed the 1947 contract,the re-enactment of the tryst with destiny.The Red Fort is a symbolism that regimes might change,but the monumentality of the state as a Leviathan is alive.The ritual overpowers any act of politics.By evoking a regime,the power of rule,the security of sovereignty,Lal Qila becomes the symbolic state.A pygmy can climb to its ramparts and still be leader,PM,emperor.The symbol works,so the state works.As a symbolic machine,the rituals at Lal Qila keep the state alive in its muscularity and monumentality.It is as if every citizen in a sacramental,almost Eucharistic,act says Give me red and the state is reborn

But Chaudhuri says it is delusional and illusory to think I can do exactly what I want to do all the time. <b><br><br>The Indian factory </b><br><br>Political science professor Achin Vanaik says freedom is best enjoyed by expanding the space for debate and for this one has to attack the power relations that restrict the agenda of discourse.Chaudhuri blames the Indian education system,which operates like a factory (and) produces individuals that go to the US to become an investment banker or a cardiac surgeon.It has created a vacuous middle class which is content with the usual markers of success. <br>There is a striking absence of even an undercurrent of dissent.Modern India revels in a consensual sense of art and politics,says Chaudhuri.Its one big happy family.We hate people in that happy family who voice dissent. Freedom becomes a captive of cultural and class prejudice.<br>Taslima Nasrin is evangelical about this.If you disagree with me,write against me,criticize me.Why issue death threats Why pick up a sword or a gun <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/17/Img/Pc01708S.jpg\"><br><font

banned,the British ruthlessly punished anyone who dared to unfurl the tricoloured flag,symbol of the Indian freedom struggle.Many defiant freedomfighters faced lathis and bullets.That was when a halwai in Benaras created the tirangi burfi,arranging layers of piste ki launj,khoye-badam ki burfi and santare ki launj one on top of the other.Meanwhile,another master confectioner named his bestselling laddoo Jawahar Bhog.As the above anecdote tells us,the imperialists tried,but couldnt tame our tastes and our tongues.<br>Independence brought liberation in myriad forms,not least the silent revolution experienced by millions since  the evolution of a pan-Indian palate.<br>Partition was painful,its scars are yet to heal and culinary nostalgia occasionally reminds us of our loss.Refugees spread out all over the land,carrying with them memories of sanjha chulha and the tasty tradition of tandoor.Men of indomitable spirit  for instance,Lambasaab of Kwality fame and Kundanlalji,who is synonymous with Moti Mahal  popularized the genre of roadside cooking and fed men without home or hearth great value-formoney,homestyle meals.Mushrooming dhabas along the highways have got Indians addicted to tandoori fare  roti,murg tikka,maa di daal,saag and more.<br>What the Punjabi refugee did for the tandoor,the Udupi entrepreneurs did for south Indian cuisine.Today,the dosa,sambar,idli,vada,upama and utthapam are encountered from Jammu and Kashmir to the furthest reaches of the northeast.Southern fare was also popularized by the Coffee Houses in Delhi,Allahabad,Chandigarh,Bhopal and many other places.Sadanand Maiya of the legendary MTR in Bangalore and Prem Koshi of Kochi come to mind as individuals who kept the tiffin  and coffee flame alive even in strong winds.What is even more remarkable is that many Indians  other than those referred to as Madrasis a generation ago  cutting across class and caste today,cook these at home regularly.<br>Then there are the famous Bengali sweets.Those prepared outside West Bengal quite often put the originals to shame.<br>Urbanization  gloriously chaotic and mostly unplanned  accelerated the decline of the joint family and weakened age-old food taboos.Some fossilized prohibitions persist but the prescription that prevails is: Adapt,Adopt and Advance.This is how and why poha,momo and dhokla have carved a niche for themselves in the average Indian kitchen.Like a powerful magnet,big cities draw immigrants from all parts of the country and act as a melting pot for diverse culinary influences to mingle.If its ready-to-eat snacks,Agare ka petha,Bikaneri bhujiya,Sholapuri chiwada,Ratlami sev continue to give the classic American chip a run for its money.<br>With greater affluence,diners are becoming more eclectic in taste and they are now sourcing food ingredients by geographical indicators  paparh-bariyan from Amritsar,basmati from Dehradun,rajma from Jammu and salmon for the tikka from Norway.<br>The Republic of Taste doesnt recognize manmade borders.<br><img

during Partition <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Sanjay Sharma | TNN </i></font><br><br>New Delhi: He was born in 1947 on a train from Pakistan to India brimming with refugees whod seen massacres of passengers.His family was fleeing Montgomery,near Lahore,on September 3,1947,when his mother went into labour at the last station inside Pakistan.Born in a rail compartment,Chander Mohan Sharma was called Relu.<br>Former deputy general manager of VSNL,Sharma says his friends,who called him Relu,are now all gone. Yet,my childhood name connects me to trains and also my old birth place,Raiwind,the last railway station in Pakistan before Ferozepur in India, said Sharma.This route closed in 1965 when India and Pakistan went to war.<br> I still remember,my sister in labour inside one of the special coaches that Pandit Nehru had sent to transport refugees from Pakistan to India.Suddenly,an old woman sitting next to my sister took charge of the situation and helped her deliver Chander.There was no lighting in compartments on instructions from the Gurkha soldiers.The delivery took place under torchlight, remembers Janak Sharma,Chander Mohans 70-yearold maternal aunt,who was present there as a seven-year-old.<br>The hand of providence was evident as the old woman,who turned midwife,kept asking to be let inside the compartment to deaf ears when the train was leaving Montgomery.That was until another one of Chander Mohans uncles on the train,Baldev Raj,pulled her in just in time.<br>Recalls Chander Mohan, My uncle helped the woman without knowing who she was.His kind-heartedness was immediately returned by God,who saved my mothers life and mine. <br>When an Indian engine took all the passengers to the safety of Ferozepur in Punjab an hour later,people turned rapturous and performed a puja for Chander Mohan,considering him their lucky mascot.It took four months for Chander Mohans father to locate his son and wife at Hisar as they had left Pakistan separately.<br>On Pakistans independence day,Chander Mohan and his wife Veena Sharma say, For us,India and Pakistan are just two names created by hatred,unleashed by a few individuals.Love still binds the two people.When we visited Pakistan looking for our house in Montgomery,we got such love from Muslims there that we realised how misplaced our fear of them was.. because of the memory of Partition massacres. <br>Sharma,who has set up satellite phone connections on Rajdhani Express trains as a VSNL officer,still looks fondly at the rail coaches  for Relu they are a lifeline in a way not many would understand.<br>One day he saw a locomotive of the same make at the Railway Museum in Delhi that brought his family from Pakistan.When Railway authorities learnt about his life story,they said they wanted his story to be displayed at the museum.<br><img

Independence Day to the diaspora rather than summoning it to its premises.<br>Indeed,instead of a serious and solemn function on the lawns of the High Commissioners official Kensington Palace residence,itll be five hours of fun and frolic at the Indian Gymkhana on the outskirts of this city.Cultural programmes,food stalls offering cuisines from different regions of the country on a complimentary basis and a raffle draw with attractive prizes will be the highlight of the day,informed Asif Ibrahim,minister (co-ordination ) at the mission and organiser of the event.A stark contrast from earlier times,when Independence Day commemoration has been a stiff affair with flag hoisting,a reading out of the Presidents speech,followed by an almost sombre consumption of samosas and sweets.<br>The High Commissions plans to alter its method of celebrating August 15 have been in the offing for at least two years.The idea was to utilize the ample facilities of the Gymkhana,which is located between Hounslow and Southall,two suburbs teeming with people of Punjabi origin.<br>The mela-like merriment is,in fact,not dissimilar to the approaches of United States embassies.In Delhi,American citizens led by their ambassador have been known to assemble at a club in Chanakyapuri,which boasts an assortment of sporting facilities including a baseball pitch.<br>Its also a moot point whether the Gymkhana should become a permanent fixture for the High Commissions Independence Day event.Its a little distant for the other significant Indian community in the UK  Gujaratis  who wouldnt mind having the function in their midst in Harrow or Wembley,even in Leicester in the east midlands of England,where 40 % of the population are of Indian descent.So,is a road show by rotation

new Marathi book that will hit the stands in September,ruler of erstwhile Baroda state,Sayajirao Gaekwad,met the German dictator during the 1936 Berlin Olympics for the same reason.<br>Gaekwad even signed a secret pact with Hitler to get his support for Indias freedom.It was known as the Baroda-Berlin Pact.Gaekwads personal assistant Vishnu Nene was sent to Germany to arrange the meeting.Gaekwad believed an enemys enemy is a friend.So,he decided to join hands with Hitler, says Dr Damodar Nene,who has written a new biography of Gaekwad and gives details of the pact.He is Vishnu Nenes son.The book,Sayajirao Gaekwad Chi Biography has been published by Ved Gandharva publishers of Pune.<br>To ensure that the British dont suspect anything,Gaekwad took their permission to attend the Berlin Olympics.His box was placed right under Hitlers during the opening ceremony, Nene says.<br>Gaekwad is believed to have promised Hitler the support of all Hindu princes in case of a war in Europe.It was agreed that Hindu princes would back Hitler during the World War II and Hitler would support India in its freedom struggle.The pact was kept a well-guarded secret as the British would have considered it an act of treason, adds Nene.<br>Gaekwad signed the pact as chancellor of the Chamber of Princes and was confident that all the members would support him, says Nene.The chamber was established in 1920 by royal proclamation to provide a forum to rulers of the princely states to voice their concerns to the British.It survived until 1947.<br>The Maratha king had even sponsored a group of sportspersons from Amravati who wanted to participate in the Olympics.He asked the sportspersons to carry a saffron flag during opening celebrations as they were representing Baroda, adds Nene.The pact was forgotten after Gaekwad died in 1939 even as the world stood on the brink of a devastating war.<br><img

<br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Partha Bhaduri | TNN </i></font><br><br>Dambulla: The first proper practice session for the Indians since their massive loss to New Zealand was a bizarre,truncated affair with skipper MS Dhoni storming off in disgust along with Dinesh Karthik,who injured his right thumb batting in the nets in what were clearly dangerous conditions.<br>The Indians arrived at around 10 am and the batsmen promptly went about their task of having a knock,only to discover the practice pitches were damp and coated with uncomfortable layers of grass,making the ball either stop and rise alarmingly or move about in unplayable fashion.Dramatic moments unfolded soon after as Karthik hurt his right thumb trying to fend off one such delivery,immediately leaving the nets in pain as physio Nitin Patel rushed to inspect the damage.<br>Dhoni,also nursing a finger injury on his right hand which he picked up during the Test series,was batting in an adjacent nets and lost his cool in uncharacteristic fashion soon after.He stormed out of the practice area saying <br>Chhey din mey ek practice wicket nehi bana sakte (in six days they cant prepare a proper practice wicket).Pura area geela hai (the entire pitch is wet). <br>He headed straight for the dressing room,a considerable walk to the other side of the huge Rangiri International Stadium,and Karthik followed him soon after.I dont know if its okay,lets wait and see, Karthik said about the injury.<br>The duo fretted and fumed in the dressing room for 15-odd minutes before leaving for the team hotel,an uncharacteristic act of protest from someone termed captain cool.Coach Gary Kirsten too appeared agitated,immediately calling for the local liaison officer and groundsmen and asking them to prepare the wickets for practice on Sunday,the eve of Indias match against Sri Lanka.A grass-cutting machine was immediately employed but by then the damage was done,and the remaining Indians instead chose to focus on fielding drills at the main ground.Though no official protest was lodged by the Indians,a pass-thebuck operation immediately got underway,with Sri Lanka Crickets national curator Anuruddha Polonwita being defiant and backing the local groundsmen.There is no conspiracy.The Indians have been practising for two days and there was no problem.The Sri Lankans have also practised here.India will practise tomorrow also, he told TOI.Local groundstaff,however,said there was a lack of communication and the nets bowlers had agreed to bowl slow,an offer which the Indians naturally refused.A source said,It was the third practice wicket which was a problem.It was unprepared and the curator and assistant curator had instructed groundsmen to tell the Indians not to use that.I dont know why the Indians insisted on using it.There will be no problem tomorrow. <br>Indias team manager Ranjib Biswal said later: There would have been no point for Dhoni and Karthik to stay back and hence they left.<br>They were naturally furious.However,there are no major injury scares,hopefully.We havent gone for any scans yet. Most players chose to attend Saturdays session,with only Ashish Nehra,who is recovering from back spasms,opting to rest.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/20/Img/Pc02011S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>TOUGH TIMES: Things are not going too well for Dhoni </i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/20/Img/Pc02013S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br>"},{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D20%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr02001%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"Self-serving officials, please make way","post":"BETWEEN THE LIES <br><b>Self-serving officials,please make way </b><br><br>We Wouldnt Mind Independence From Evils That Have Dogged Our Sports <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>BOBILLI VIJAY KUMAR </i></font><br><br><br>As India celebrates its 63rd birthday,one cant help but wonder about the state of sport in the country: Have we made any progress here,as a people at all Is there anything to be proud of really Or does the mirror laugh at us,just as it does whenever it sees the poverty,illiteracy and I-dont-give-a-truck attitude around it <br>To be fair,once upon a time in hockey,we used to be kings;we are a major force in cricket today,both on the field and off it;we have produced countless diamonds too,right from Gavaskar to Tendulkar,from Kapil (despite his brief dalliance with the murky world) to Kumble.<br>More hearteningly,we have also seen individuals blaze turfs against all odds,all the way from Usha to Anand to Bindra to Nehwal.They all deserve a salute on this special day,if not our eternal gratitude.<br>Beyond the glory and glitter,however,lurks the grime and goriness: despite growing as an economic and IT power,we are nothing more than pygmies in the world of sport;why,we are still galaxies away from becoming a major even in Asia.<br>And this is not because we dont have the means,resources or talent to take on the world,if not beat it;it is because our sporting machinery had been hijacked by an evil system and has been in its grip even before we could really understand the meaning of true Independence.So,on this day,as we step into a new dawn (hopefully),maybe we should pray for freedom... <b><br><br>... from obnoxious,self-serving people masquerading as sports administrators.<br></b><br><br>We are,of course,referring to politicians and bureaucrats.Right at the start,they carved fiefdoms out of each sport and have ruled them since then like autocrats.<br>They are not interested in the game or the players who toil in their blood,sweat and tears for a moment of excellence,if not glory.The not so dangerous ones are happy enjoying minor benefits in their honorary roles,including free trips,meager daily allowances and some media exposure;but there are quite a few who are in it for the big money too.<br>They make false promises,sell mega dreams and get away with smiles on their faces.As the Commonwealth Games loot is showing,they are not even reprimanded,forget booted out or flogged in public;that is,of course,because,for the high and mighty,it is nothing but a political game,with a lot more than power at stake.<b><br><br>... from extravagant Games which serve no purpose at all.<br></b><br><br>When will the country learn that this is nothing but a con job Only those who live in Delhi know what hell they have gone through in the last couple of years in the name of CWG.In the end,we will be left with giant stadia which will not be used by anyone.<br>Sure,some people will be richer and happier;and yes,the same people will turn up a few months later and raise the bogey for the Asian Games,then the Olympics,then God alone knows what.<b><br><br>...

Decisions <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Partha Bhaduri | TNN </i></font><br><br>Dambulla: Faced with a litany of injury worries and a barrage of constant cricket heading into the World Cup,Team Indias support staff is inculcating newer fitness methodologies,including revamped assessment procedures and holistic improvement measures intended to keep players physically agile and mentally fresh.This new approach of self-organized learning,a customized nuts-and-bolts operation of principled preparation based on personal initiative,also includes the development of an amenable dressing-room atmosphere,something recently praised by VVS Laxman as the best ambience he has worked in.The enhanced and strict emphasis on fitness is also intended to work as a natural culling process,with players who cut corners with their routines being found out.<br>The starting point of this new pathway,said Indias first mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton,involves awareness and selfappraisal.In India fitness isnt in the culture.If youre training because somebody tells you to,its difficult.Were trying to encourage players to make their own decisions so we can assist them with their thinking as we train.Its self-organized learning,when a player practices doing his own thinking.Its a system of gaining awareness and overcoming instincts. <br>The attempt came about,said Upton,when he and coach Gary Kirsten realized most players fitness schedules went awry the moment they left the national set-up,or they discovered that doing a players thinking for him wasnt helping in match situations.Being sensitive to cultural conditioning was the biggest challenge for the duo.<br>The new methods are also intended to help important players like Yuvraj Singh,currently struggling with fitness issues and lack of form,to revitalize themselves.Asked about the back-up staff s views on Yuvraj,Upton said,The mental challenges come when you get injured,get dropped or have a low run of form.You go through a natural process of disappointment,frustration and wanting to give up.Were teaching these players to move through that phase quickly and regain the mental,physical and technical condition necessary to be a serious competitor.How strongly an individual can come back is a test of character. <br>This is where mental conditioning,a rarely-understood terminology,comes in.Upton explained: It involves the attitude you adopt to fitness and not the knowledge.Traditionally coaches in cricket do the thinking for the player.Yet when you cross the ropes you must think for yourself.The mental part involves passing the message though Kirsten,and everything we do revolves around the players  mental well-being.It all starts with coming out of a happy dressing room,which weve worked hard at. <br><img

flying high after a dashing win against India,the loss to Lanka brings them on par with India now.The Lankans while chasing the bonus point lost wickets in a cluster but they had done well at the start to ensure a win.It also underlined the fact that winning is more about determination and though the Lankans missed out on the bonus point,they eventually got the better of the Kiwis.<br>India face a crunch game against the hosts,Sri Lanka,who look to be the favourites for the final.The Lankan bowlers did well to resist the Kiwis the other day and Lasith Malinga was outstanding.Though their opener Dilshan got out early they were pretty much in control all through their innings.<br>The Indian team has been feeling the heat for some time now but to me the decision to rush in Munaf Patel as a standby for the struggling Ishant Sharma has been surprising.Munaf is talented indeed but his fitness is a worry.He has been around for sometime but has failed to deliver.With young bowlers like Umesh Yadav,Dhaval Kulkarni,Sudeep Tyagi,RP Singh and Manpreet Gony being overlooked,it just doesnt seem right.Also what happens to the likes of spinners Piyush Chawla or Ramesh Powar.<br>In the present day format every player needs to be good in two departments being it bowling,batting or fielding.A one-dimensional player is often more a carry for a team than advantage.With the run-up to the 2011 World Cup,this series was an ideal situation to try out combinations but that hasnt been the case.<br>Also,what happens to the secondary teams that are to be the supply line for the national squad.NIMBUS SPORT <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/20/Img/Pc02012S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>BACK IN FAVOUR: Munaf Patel </i></font><br><img

in need of a bowling allrounder","post":"PLATINUM MOMENTS SUNIL GAVASKAR <br><b>India in need of a bowling allrounder </b><br><br><br>Sri Lankas narrow win over the New Zealand team opens up the tri series and gives India a chance to come back in the tournament after beginning it with an abject display not seen in recent years from them.Yes,they were once again not given much to get on to the front foot as they like but were pinned on the back half of the crease by bowling that was welldirected though not of great speed.It is now a tactic that opposition bowlers will use regularly unless the Indians show that they can counterattack and put those short balls away.<br>One of the batsmen capable of doing that is the skipper himself.He is one of the cleanest hitters of the ball bowled halfway down the pitch and plays the pull and hook shots well.<br>He will do well to promote himself up the order when the opposition has the new ball and its bowlers are looking to restrict the batsman with short-of-a-length deliveries.<br>What batsmen will do well to remember is that in that heat and humidity the bowlers will not be able to bowl too many such deliveries as it consumes a lot of energy.Moreover,they have to be accurate too else they will be called for bowling too high and wide.So,batsmen can either play the waiting game or counterattack.In limited overs batsmen dont have the luxury of leaving too many balls alone and thats why shot-selection will be crucial.<br>Indias problem is finding a bowling allrounder who can bowl his quota of overs inexpensively and beef up the lower order.<br>Ravindra Jadeja,who enjoys that position currently,has had his moments in the past but has had a rough last few months and the tri-series is his a last chance to redeem himself.PMG

size=\"1\"><i>Sarath Pookkat | TNN </i></font><br><br>Chennai: Jo Paul Ancheri had the most cultured left foot of his times and was an all-round footballer in every sense of the word.He could play as a defender,a midfielder who could dictate the pace of the play and also striker.Though hampered with injuries,his career spanned for more than a decade and his combination with IM Vijayan was surely the best of the times.Ancheri,who is now the coach of the Mohun Bagan Academy,one of the teams currently participating in the VP Sathyan Memorial Gold Cup in the city,told TOI about all these and much more.Excerpts: <b><br><br>What are your memories of Chennai <br></b><br><br>Not really happy memories... It was here where I first injured my knee.It was on December 25 and India were playing Nepal in the semifinals.Although we we won that match and went on to beat Bangladesh in the final,I couldnt play and it was the start of a long list of injuries.<b><br><br>Who is the player to look out for in India <br></b><br><br>Mohammad Rafi.He was a very consistent scorer for Mahindra last season and Bob Houghton rewarded his performance with a place in the Indian team.Hes got a stylish game,is very sharp.Stephen Dias,Clifford Miranda are also really good.<b><br><br>What about Sunil Chhetri and his stint in the US <br></b><br><br>He has performed really well in the club level and for the country for the past few years and he has worked hard.He is a good player,but not an exceptional talent like Vijayan.<b><br><br>What about your partnership with IM Vijayan <br></b><br><br>Vijayan was a once in a lifetime talent for India.And to his credit,he polished it brilliantly.I am glad I played with him for 10 years.We started playing together for Mohun Bagan in 1993,went to JCT,FC Kochi,Mohun Bagan again,FC Kochin again,East Bengal and JCT.Had Vijayan been playing now,with these improved facilities and coaching he surely would have been an even better player.Who knows maybe he would have played in an European League.<b><br><br>So,the infrastructure and the standard of coaching has improved over the years.</b><br><br>Yes definitely,it has improved.AIFFs decision to give central contracts to 30 players with a 15 per cent hike in their existing pay with the clubs is a good thing and it will only help the team bind together.I think it was Houghtons idea and he has done well with the team.We have quite a few overseas training tours which will give the team more exposure.We have more focus now.<b><br><br>But we still dont have enough grounds.</b><br><br>Thats one thing the football associations should give attention to.Good grounds are the basic need for better football.We have made the Salt Lake stadium pitch into synthetic turf and it was not a very smart thing to do.Synthetic turf is a bit hard and if it is not maintained properly will result to injuries for players.<b><br><br>Why do you think Kerala football is going downhill </b><br><br>Keralas problems start with the lack of good grounds.One thing the authorities should make sure is that football grounds are used for playing football only.Let cultural avtivities,film award nights,political rallies,athletics and other sports find some other place.Even laying an athletics track outside the football field is not good.It distances the game from its livewire,the spectators.And thats the worst thing that could happen to the sport.Any sport.<b><br><br>How is the Mohun Bagan Football Academy doing <br></b><br><br>I have joined the acdemy last year and Im reasonably happy with what we have achieved.We have young players graduating from the academy.This year a couple of players who trained there - Dipendu Duwari and Souvik Chakraborty joined the Mohun Bagan senior side.<b><br><br>You have been in Bengal at the peak of your career.Has anything changed there over the past few years <br></b><br><br>The passion for the game is still as strong as it was during my playing days.Earlier the transfer season was so full of frantic activities,but now because both the teams are being sponsored by the same group,it has become less stormy.And I have noticed that there are less players from Kolkata now.<b><br><br>Could Santosh Trophy victory be the shot in the arm Bengal football needed <br></b><br><br>That was a great victory.Even though they lost to Tamil Nadu in the quarterfinal league,they played really good football in the semifinals and the final.We have a lot of academies coming up there in Kolkata,which states like Kerala lack.<b><br><br>What do you think about Denson Devadas <br></b><br><br>Denson Devadas played really well.Though his long ranger was the more spectacular of the goals I thought the header was even more telling.To be there at the right moment and to connect with such accuracy need some doing.And he is a player who can hold the midfield together.<b><br><br>What are your chances here <br></b><br><br>Well play our game.We are not worried who our opponents are.We just want to give it our best shot.<br><img

him a red card.<br>Josco,for a while,looked like making their numerical advantage count,having decent ball posssession and creating some good chances but Joseph Perera was guilty of muffing up the chances that came his way.Ramesh was having a good game and was the livewire for the Chennai team before he got himself ousted.<br>An early goal from David had settled the nerves for the Chennai team and Ramesh had a nice chance to double the lead ten minutes into the second half.<br>His speed and quick feet helped him escape the clutches of Josco defence through the right flank but with only goalkeeper to beat,the striker scuffed his shot wide of the right post.<br>But he didnt have to wait long for the goal and it was right out of the drawing board.A cross from the top of the box after a quickly taken corner found Ramesh with space and time and he cooly headed the ball in.That was the last postive contribution from the striker before he got the marching orders but by then Josco had almost lost their will to fight.A man advantage brought some life into them but their shooting was horribly off target and feeble.<br>Later,Tamil Nadu XI completed a perfect day for the city teams as they routed Akbar Travels Football Club,Mumbai 3-0.After a slow and scrappy start TN XI scored through their Nigerian striker Jeribe in the 27th minute.Jeribe then turned the provider with a lovely

reply,the Lankans lost Dilshan quite cheaply.His partner Tharanga though,kept his cool and took the team to safety with a nicely constructed innings of 70.But soon after his dismissal,the middle-order batsmen lost their way in pursuit of the bonus point that was in the offering.But,sanity prevailed in the end,as they settled for a win,which was the top priority.<br>Meanwhile,the Indian team will now be eagerly looking forward to their match against the Sri Lankans.After having started the tournament on a bad note,the Indian side will be hungry and determined to get the win under their belt.I dont see the Indian team making any drastic changes to the side,but I would be interested to know,in what Dhoni does with the fifth bowler,Ravindra Jadeja might get another chance,but Dhoni may be tempted to play extra batsmen,and ask Yuvraj and Sehwag to contribute with their part time spin.PMG <br><img

tournament are very evenly matched and I am anticipating a very tough fight for a berth in the final.<br>Indias game on Monday will be especially difficult because theyll be hurting badly after their huge loss to the Black Caps in the tournament opener.New Zealands quick bowlers really put them under pressure and announced their teams positive intent.<br>While the overall results in Dambulla indicate a relatively fair balance between batting first or second  the team winning the toss has chosen to bat 25 times out of 38 matches and won 13 times  the conditions are definitely more favourable to the side batting first when it is a day-night game.<br>That makes our win against New Zealand on Friday night even more pleasing.Conditions were not in our favour,with some early movement off the seam and uneven bounce when we started our chase,but we pulled through thanks to a great knock by Upul Tharanga and that gives us all confidence.The pitch was a bit drier than the first game and that meant that the slower bowlers like Scott Styris and the spinners were a bit harder to score off than the fast bowlers.The ball was holding-up a little and you could see the surface breaking-up.I found it tough but Tharanga made it look flat.<br>The disappointment for us was not getting the bonus point.We needed about 60 runs from six overs with a Powerplay in hand and that was an opportunity we are keen to seize.GAMEPLAN <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/21/Img/Pc02116S.jpg\"><br><font

that meant,that there was still time enough for the bowlers to make their mark on the game.The earlier two Tests had been pretty much hard work for little or no reward for the Indian bowlers in particular.<br>The fourth days pitch did assist the spinners,but it was the innocuous but shrewd off spin of Virender Sehwag that gave India the opening that they needed to try and get back in the game.Dhoni has realized how clever a bowler Sehwag is,and tosses the ball to him whenever his regular bowlers fail to do the business for him.<br>The one man who did not get lulled into lowering his guard when Viru came on to bowl was Thilan Samaraweera,who got a well crafted century in the first innings and stood watching at the other end in the second innings,as the Indians spun the web around the Lankan batsmen.In England,Pakistan floundered again to the moving ball and looked totally at sea against the England seamers.Why they opted to bat first in gloomy conditions is a mystery,for those were tailormade for seamers be it English or Pakistani bowlers.Pakistan will be hoping that the weather is better for the last two Tests and they can thus salvage the series.<br>Two games with different stories,one game swung one way and then the other,while the one in England went one teams way right from day one.Thilan Samaraweera for his terrific batting in both innings of the last Test is the Ceat international cricketer of the week.PMG <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/21/Img/Pc02117S.jpg\"><br><font

confidence into as many games as possible,exploit that form as well as you can.And if you have lost,you run the risk of thinking too much about defeat and focusing on what went wrong.It could lead to too many team meetings and as we all know,the greater the number of meetings,the deeper the trouble you are in! <br>But four or five players in this team would have enjoyed the break.Playing day in and day out,like acting or writing,can produce ennui,a sameness of action and the mind can grow weary.A little time off and you are ready for what you love best.But India cannot project that as a reason for their sluggishness since six of the eleven players hadnt played the Tests! If India were strong enough the new players should have carried the team with them.<br>Dhoni must think he hasnt won a toss since he went with the close cropped hair.But sadly losing four tosses in a row doesnt give him a better chance of winning a fifth and so while India would love to bat first at Dambulla (as they did when Dhoni won the toss in the Asia Cup final),they need to show more purpose in case they dont.I just wonder if it may not be a bad idea to play a seventh batsman in Virat Kohli and ask the batsmen to take the responsibility of bowling ten overs.TCM <br><img

an timely break in the inclement weather to grab the clubhouse lead in the second round of the US PGA Championship on Friday.Kuchar added a 69 to his opening round of 67 to reach the halfway stage at eight under par and leading by one shot from his countryman Nick Watney,who carded a 68,with a group of seven players,including Britains Rory McIlroy and South Korean teenager Noh Seung-yul,a further shot back at five-under.<br>Exactly half of the 156-player field,including world number one Tiger Woods,failed to finish their second rounds after spending most of the day cooling their heels following another delayed start at the Whistling Straits course that hugs the coastline of Lake Michigan.Almost six hours were lost on the first two days because of the thick blanket of fog each morning,leaving organisers scrambling to get the last major of the year back on schedule.<br>Kuchar was among the 78 players who had to complete their opening rounds early on Friday morning but then got the benefit of going straight back out to play their second rounds before the wind picked up late in the afternoon.<br>This is certainly a great place to be, said Kuchar,whose best finish at a major was tied for sixth at this years US Open.Im looking forward to the opportunity to really do something great this weekend. <br>Britains Simon Khan briefly joined Kuchar at eight under but bogeyed the last three holes to slip back to a tie for third and leave Watney as Kuchars closest challenger.The course really showed teeth today, Khan said.South Africas Ernie Els also had trouble at the end of his round,finishing with a double bogey to end on two under.Its not how you want to finish.It was a difficult day, said Els.I scrambled quite well here and there but just let it go at the end there. <br>US Masters champion Phil Mickelson had an up and down day,struggling to find the fairway,but holed some long putts for a 69 to join Els at two under.I just want to be in a position where if I play like I know I can,I can make up some ground, he said.And I feel like Im within striking distance. <br>Woods,who shot 71 on the opening day,made a solid start to his second round,scrambling to par his first six holes to remain at one under when play was suspended because of fading light.It was tough out there,blowing pretty good,had to be very patient, Woods said.<br>I had to hang in there and did a good job with that.Unfortunately I missed a short one (putt) there at the last one I played but other than that,it was all right. <br>American Jason Dufner shot a superb 66,the lowest completed round of the championship,to join Bryce Molder (67),Dustin Johnson (68),Zach Johnson (70),McIlroy,Khan and Noh at five-under.McIlroy had an adventurous day,playing one brilliant recovery shot from the waters edge,and holding his nerve in the tricky conditions to put himself in contention to challenge for his first major title.I feel as if Im in a really good position going into the weekend and I like the position Im in, he said.Well see how the guys in the afternoon make out,but I feel as if Im in a strong position and a position where I can make a charge for the weekend.

Anil says Chennai,as indeed the south,holds a special place in his heart.The south,particularly Chennai,is at the very centre of my being because it is from here that I learnt professionalism.When I came here to shoot for the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham directed by Bapu,which was shot in Rajamundhry and Chennai,I was impressed by how efficiently everything worked here,and the premium placed on punctuality and discipline. <br>With both daughters Sonam and Rhea coming into their own,what does the proud father feel is his share in their success Somewhere,I must have done something good.I gave them the right amount of freedom.Well,biologically,too,I mustve done something right, he says,tongue firmly in cheek.<br>While Slumdog Millionaire might have given Anil much global visibility,hes clearly moved on to other things.Lets not talk about SDM,Ive it coming out of my ears.Catch me on 24,the American TV serial in which Ive recently debuted.Im overwhelmed by the rave reviews Ive garnered. He continues,Initially,Id misgivings about how Id pull it off.Playing a president from a Middle East country didnt seem like a cakewalk.Plus,the fact that Im quite ignorant about the politics of the region.But Im thrilled at the outcome.This has been a 360 degree experience for me. <br>With one as handsome as him,how is it that theres not a shred of controversy around him Wicked smile in place,Anil responds,Im lucky not to have been caught! But,on a serious note,I am very sensitive about how my actions could affect others. And then with that gleam in his eye,Anil adds,Youve got to credit my wife Sunita for keeping me on a tight leash! <br>About Mr India 2,Anil says,For sure,well get on to it by next year. And will he and Sridevi be the lead pair Well have to wait and see.Nothing is certain,not even my playing Mr India. But will Shekhar Kapur be directing it No,it wont be him, is all Anils willing to reveal.<br>Talking of his wish list,Anil rattles off,I love to switch genres,and am not hung up on being the leading man as long as my characters strong.With SDM and 24,an entire world has opened up to me,and Im going to grab it with both my hands.Id love to work with Inception director Christopher Nolan and with Robert Downing Junior,and sure once again with Danny Boyle.Im upbeat about the future. <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/29/Img/Pc02915S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/29/Img/Pc02908S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>ROBUST!

and women dont always agree.Foreplay is essential if you want the act to be pleasurable for both the partners.It is particularly important for women to have successful foreplay because it takes a woman longer time than a man,to get up to the level of arousal needed to climax.A man can think about sex and be aroused,but for most women,thats just not enough.Foreplay plays a physical and emotional role,preparing both mind and body for sex.<br>For a woman love is very important and she needs her man to not just show that he really loves her,but also say it.The next most important thing is time.Do not be in a hurry to finish the act.Even undressing should be done at a snails pace with many pauses in between for light kisses.A woman responds well to touch and caress.Give her feather

incompetency in professional set-ups <br><br><br>Will Amitabh Bachchan be perceived any lesser an actor in the film industry if hed sport a tee and torn jeans Will corporate biggies Narayan Murthy and Indra Nooyi be considered incompetent if they dressed casually Does dress code have an impact on how you are perceived at your workplace  Experts from various fields in Mumbai remain mixed in their opinion yet most feel that a duck remains a duck.However well a duck (an under-performer ) is dressed,it still doesnt have more than a sessile,sitting position.One who calls the shots at work is often perceived even more confident if he/she can pull off any attire,formal or casual.<br>The new-age thinking about professional dress codes in India is about dressing smartly.Says designer Manish Malhotra,Dressing up smartly is the keyword.If your work is good,then no one can question your dressing style,for its an extension of your personality.Competitiveness depends on work and not clothes. Social butterfly Queenie Singh opines,I dont think dressing up casually has anything to do with incompetency.. It depends a lot on what your line of work calls for and demands.If it requires starched shirts or ties,so be it.If not,its okay.As long as the mind is alert and focussed and also the results are good,you are accepted. <br>However,a recent international poll about dress codes involving 12,500 people in 24 countries had interesting results.Europeans were found the most casually dressed to work.And Indians were the smartest with their work attires.Over 66 per cent Indian workers said senior managers should always be dressed up better than their employees.Four out of 10 people said people who were casually dressed will not make the top management.Sweden was at the bottom of the poll with only 27 per cent saying that casual dressing would be a bar to entering senior management.<br>Fashion designer Neeta Lulla voices her support to the formal attire stating,Casual dressing can portray a carefree attitude.Many MBA students dress up in flipflops and T-shirts during the student years but when you want to be taken more seriously,then the entire persona needs to look more serious,right till the dress code. <br><img

TO SUCCESS","post":"VIBE RIGHT <br><b>GATEWAY TO SUCCESS </b><br><br>Proper positioning of the main door can bring good luck to a house and its occupants <br><br><br>Understanding the science of feng shui and adapting it in the design of homes calls for precision combined with tasteful aesthetics.When we look at a building,the first impression we derive determines the kind of energy existing within it and you get a feel about the lifestyle of the occupants too.<br>Designing and placing the main door and frame is an essential part of a building construction.Hence adapting the right dimensions,material and position ensures that the house is not deprived of good energy which would in turn affect the occupants over a period of time.<br>The main door is the most important area in a building;both vaastu and feng shui attach great importance not just to the position but also to the auspicious time to place the frame and door during construction.The main entrance holds a unique position in relation to the rest of the doors in the house.So,additional care is required in attending to the requirements of this door.<br>The positioning of the main door is quite critical as each compass direction has exalted or positive effect or debilitated or negative effect.Extra care has to be taken to ensure that the main door is in the exalted position.<br>The front door is considered as the mouth of the building;hence,it should be large and inviting.The ideal height for a door should be approximately three times the width of the door.If you notice a shortcoming in the door,do not go for a replacement right away.The remedy lies in giving an artful decorative treatment along the margin around the main frame to make it stand out and speak for itself.<br>The main door frame must be provided with a threshold (door sill) at the bottom.This serves as a safety measure against insects,rodents and reptiles which otherwise might enter through the passage lurking in the small space between the shutter and the floor.From a vaastu and feng shui perspective,the missing fourth side of the frame,which rests firmly on the floor,represents the element composed of fulfilment,wholesomeness and stability.So,a main door frame with four sides is considered good;if it has windows on either side,its even better.<br>It is considered auspicious if the entrance to the property and the main door of the house are on the same side while it is inauspicious if the main door to the house is on the opposite side to the entrance of the property.Water bodies like underground tanks,septic tanks,or canals under the main entrance are considered a taboo as they are said to cause loss of wealth and trigger sickness to the occupants.<b><br><br>SBS SURENDRAN Master

heavy weights is the key to build muscle size.However,a new study has shown that a similar degree of muscle building can be achieved by using lighter weights.The secret,researchers say,is to pump iron until you reach muscle fatigue.Rather than grunting and straining to lift heavy weights,you can grab something much lighter but lift it until you cant lift it anymore.Growing muscle means stimulating your muscle to make new muscle proteins,a process in the body that over time accumulates into bigger muscles.The study shows that it isnt really the weight that you lift but the fact that you get muscular fatigue thats the critical point in building muscle.This new data could have practical significance for gym enthusiasts and even for people with compromised skeletal muscle mass,such as the elderly,patients with cancer,or those who are recovering from trauma,surgery or strokes.<br>ANI <br><img

outfit for a party.She has two mobile phones - a Black Berry and a Samsung - and recently picked up a pair of fancy shoes at Rs 4,000.Her parents had to shell out Rs 6,000 for a huge stuffed toy.<br>A snap poll conducted by TIMESLife ! in five metros - Delhi,Mumbai,Chennai,Kolkata and Bangalore - on the spending habits of youngsters,indicated that only young Kolkatans seem to be saving,from their average allowance of Rs 2,000 per month.Girls saved up to 13 per cent while boys kept about nine per cent aside.The rest of the country's youngsters seem to be blowing up their entire allowance and not managing to save anything.<br>Mumbai girls lead as far as expenses on clothes is concerned with 22 per cent of their monthly allowance spent on them,while Delhi girls spend exorbitantly on beauty treatments.Most college-going students from affluent families in Delhi and Chennai were found having credit or debit cards,sometimes even two to three.Says Sushant Shivram,a student from Jaihind College,Mumbai on what he has observed among his classmates,\"Every month about Rs 500 cash is given in hand for their daily requirement,the rest they pull out from the ATM,but the bank statement goes to their parents.\"<br>Seventeen-year-old Apurva earlier spent about Rs 1,500 every month but now flashes a credit card.Adds Raisa unapologetically,\"I have a lot of friends I need to stay in touch with.And if they buy a top or jeans then it doesn't look good if I don't have trendy clothes.\"<br>Looking good and appearances are important and youngsters across India spend the most each week on clothes,mobile phones and going out as per the study.Food also tops their passions.On an average,about 30 per cent of their pocket money is spent on food,as per the survey.<br>Says Harish Nambiar,a college student from Bangalore,\"Bangalore has no beach and no other places to hang out,which is why we go to cafes to eat.About half my pocket money goes on food.\"Girls spend the most on clothes,cosmetics and toiletries as compared to boys who spend maximum on computer games and equipments.Gadgets (including mobile phone),r e c r e at i o n and holidays,hobby classes,f i t n e s s

dating and buying gifts for her boyfriends.\"Secret whispers have begun,\"laughs Sulekha,whose pockets are invaded for Sakshi's blow drying and other beauty treatments.<br>Boys from the South were found more romantic as compared to their counterparts in M u m b a i,Delhi and Kolkata.In Bangalore and Chennai,boys spent 18 per cent and 13 per cent respectively on their girlfriends while Mumbai and Delhi boys spent five percent and Kolkata spent just one per cent on dating and girlfriends.<br>\"Youngsters believe that a swipe of a card can buy them anything.PSP games,ipods,different colour shoes,perfumes,deos they are all very brand conscious,want to show off,be popular,so there is no upper limit to money.And then they get bored with these things very fast and want to replace these,\"adds Sulekha.<br>With independence being more intoxicating than money itself,most youngsters get happiness when they pick up the phone and order pizzas and colas themselves,say parents.\"Some

minutes to an hour at the caf over several cups of coffee and food to go with it.\"At a televis i o n show held recently for youngsters,when Chennai students got ipods as gift,they were thrilled whereas the Mumbai team was indifferent.Youngsters from middle class homes in Chennai on an average draw about Rs 500 to Rs 800 per month as pocket allowance.\"I spend largely on junk food and movies,watching movies is much cheaper in Chennai than in Mumbai or Delhi,\"says Nikhil Arvind,a student from Chennai,who gets just about Rs 200 every month.However,the survey showed surprising results among the affluent class and college students in Chennai are getting anywhere between Rs 8,000 and Rs 15,000 as monthly allowance.<br>Ask and you shall receive... a lot of money.That's the

again.For,she knows.A woman has eyes at the back of her head when it comes to a man looking at her in a particular manner.Her antenna starts beeping and she reacts or responds,depending on how she feels about you! <br>So knock those eyeballs back in and roll your lolling tongue right back.For,she could be having a good laugh at your expense.And,the woman who is with you She certainly knows what you are up to as well and is just waiting for you to turn and look her way.Seen the new Anne French ad A guy swivels around to look at a pair of silky smooth legs that walk into a restaurant.His eyes follow the legs as they are crossed sensuously,one on top of the other.As he turns back to his female companion,he is greeted with a resounding slap.Camera pans to Kareena;she winks at the girl,who winks back,and they exchange a smile.Kareena looks into the camera and says,Breakup karwana ho ya gorgeous skin paana ho,naya.. Anne French Roll.Life is on a roll! <br>An apt representation of reality.The only one whos left feeling the fool is the man now alone at the table.The women have conspired,taken advantage of his natural male weakness and played a trick on him.And,why not If you go around begging for it,anyone would take advantage.If you show your interest so blatantly,you are bound to be taken for a ride! <br>If men have been accused of sexual harassment at the workplace,women have their own brand of harassment which uses their own sexuality as their most potent weapon.This is the raunch culture that Ariel Levy blasts in her book Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the rise of Raunch Culture.She blames present American culture squarely for encouraging women to objectify themselves,because of which young girls believe they have to be the hottest and the sexiest rather than the most accomplished.<br>If Male Chauvinist Pigs were men who regarded women as pieces of meat,we would outdo them and be Female Chauvinist Pigs: women who make sex objects of other women and of ourselves, says Ariel,dripping sarcasm in her book.In doing so women seem to strangely imagine they are furthering the cause of Feminism.In reducing the amount of clothing we wear,in piercing our navels and whatever else,and in exposing cleavages and thongs,we imagine we are exhibiting the freedom of choice and spirit of independence.As if in the display of skin and the stupefying effect it seems to have on men,we are empowered.And men seem not to understand the game in which they are led by the ernose,willingly enough.If the boss is lascivious,there is a certain kind of girl who will take full advantage of his weakness and think nothing of exploiting it.She will string him along,flutter her eyelashes,smile enchantingly and give him wet dreams for a long,long time.She may even throw in some suggestive jokes on the cellphone or a naughty message just as he gets ready for bed at night.And not just the lascivious ones,even men who are obviously in awe of pretty yo u n g things and all but pant at their sight,are likely to be led d ow n t h e g a r - den path by a girl skilled enough at the art,with no compunction.<br>The middle-aged Indian male is a sitting duck for the Lipstick Feminists who think nothing of using their sexuality as bait and consider sexual allure as synonymous with women empowerment.So make no mistake.When she leans over to hand you the papers,she knows exactly where your eyes are straying and staying stuck.When she bends to pick up the papers that have slipped to the floor,she knows you are trying to decipher the tattooed words just above her butt cleavage or admiring the colour of her thong.And when she is explaining the intricacies of her labour on the project you gave her,she knows as you stroke your chin thoughtfully,you are more focused on the images playing out in your mind rather than her words! <br>Despite your words of encouragement and lavish praise,she knows its not her work that inspires those words of admiration,but your hope of what else she may be willing to do for you.The younger the girl,the more the older boss is flattered by her attentions.And if she knows this,why then would she not take advantage of the guys slippery morality to further her own cause She may or may not give you what you want but she will certainly string you along and milk you for what its worth! <br>As women shed clothes and inhibitions,Ariel complains in her book,Spectacles of naked ladies have moved from seedy side streets to center-stage,where everyone  men and women  can watch them in broad daylight.Playboy and its ilk are being embraced by young women in a curious way in a post-feminist world,to borrow the words of Hugh Hefner. <br>However,much as all men are not predators,all women out there are not using their sexuality to lure men either.Most of us,men as well as women,just do our own thing.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/42/Img/Pc04206S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br>"},{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D42%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr04201%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"Brownies lesson","post":"Soul Curry <br><b>Brownies lesson </b><br><br>A tenacious little blind pup teaches Madhumita Gupta an important lesson <br><br><br>BROWNIE was a beautiful small pup with no eyes and a stray at that,when I first saw him.What chances would you give him How could such a vulnerable little thing survive the severely hostile conditions  the busy street which was his home;limited food,often no food;six other equally hungry pups who had eyes and could see It was a foregone conclusion that before long hed either starve to death or get hit by a speeding vehicle.The theory of survival of the fittest unfortunately also applies to strays anywhere in the world.<br>Brownie was the handsomest of the litter  a delicate shade of ginger with a perfect white collar,quizzical black brows,a long whitetipped tail  forever wagging.He used to be so happy just being alive.Even physically he had been the strongest,the natural leader.And then,overnight,his eyes went opaque and he was blind.<br>We despaired for him as he bumped into walls and gates,tumbled into ditches,escaped within inches of his life from speeding bikes and got his food stolen by his siblings from right under his nose.Very soon his ribs stood out against his now dull coat,while his siblings got fitter on his share.<br>Should we adopt him was the question that tortured us every day but our selfish love for our own pet quelled the intention.We didnt know what mysterious ailment had rendered him blind and we couldnt risk our pets health,already delicate because of her age.<br>We gave up on Brownie,in our typically fatalistic human way,remembering to add a prayer for a quick and painless release from his misery.But did Brownie give up on life,and throw in the towel as easily No way.His awkward uncertainty,his misery lasted precisely for a fortnight! And fortune favoured the gutsy little pup by stopping whatever that ailed him at just blindness.<br>In that short duration,he learnt new survival skills and quickly mastered them.He trained his nose and ears to make up for his eyes.No more stumbling for him! Hes the first one to dash for food,the moment anybody opens a gate to leave out food,a custom many in the neighbourhood follow.Any other pup,audacious enough to steal his food,gets a taste of his sharp teeth on his ears or neck! By cocking up his ears,Brownie,I think,manages to somehow make out the sounds of an approaching vehicle and retires to safety much before his sighted siblings.In the scorching summers,he makes his way unwaveringly towards the shadiest patches and water.<br>And,above all,his joie de vivre remains as infectious as ever as he continues to gambol with the same gay abandon as soon as it gets cool in the evenings.In him,I see the personification of the Serenity prayer many of us know,but few remember in a crisis: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;courage to change the things I can;and wisdom to know the difference <br>Brownie had the courage to change what he could,he learnt to depend more on his nose and ears;to fortuitously accept what he couldnt,his blindness.<br>Does he ever miss his sight Maybe.But his tail tells a different story.Does he feel sorry for himself His jaunty gait tells me otherwise.<br>Against all the odds,happily,hes proved us wrong.This survivor is still very much there,healthier than before and as frisky as ever.Those who dont know him cant even guess that hes as blind as a bat! <br>What Brownie had taught us without even trying was that we all have it in us to possess that higher wisdom which had guided him.What we need is a little retrospection,a bit more faith in ourselves and a whole lot more faith in Him.<br><b><br><br>(Soul Curry is a column where we invite our readers to share their soul-stirring experiences) </b><br><br><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/42/Img/Pc04208S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br>"},{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D42%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr04202%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"Celeb Cook-in","post":"Ritu Dalmia Restaurateur <br><b>Celeb Cook-in </b><br><br>Celeb Cook-in introduces you to the lesser-known foodie hidden in our better-known faces <br><br><b>MY FAVOURITE DISH I </b><br><br>I cant resist kadi chawal,Punjabi style.I find it delicious and tangy. <b><br><br>I LIKE TO EAT AT I </b><br><br>One of my favourite places is China Kitchen at the Hyatt,New Delhi.They serve some authentic Chinese dishes. <b><br><br>MY FAVOURED CUISINE I </b><br><br>I enjoy simple Marwari food and exotic Italian cuisine. <b><br><br>BEST MEAL IVE EVER HAD I </b><br><br>I had loads of fun cooking for Queen Paula of Belgium.We did a tasting menu for her,starting with crab and avocado salad,followed by prawns poached in Limoncello and then served grilled John Dory with wok fried scallops and white asparagus. <b><br><br>MY NON-FOOD PASSIONS I </b><br><br>I enjoy reading at leisure,and soft music.I choose all the musical play-lists for my restaurants. <b><br><br>MY FAVOURITE RECIPE I </b><br><br>Its Sicilian Caponata. <b><br><br>Ritu Dalmias Sicilian Caponata </b><br><br><b><br><br>INGREDIENTS </b><br><br>I Medium sized eggplant,(cut into 2-inch pieces): 2 I Olive oil: 2 tbsp I Small onion (chopped): 1 I Garlic clove (chopped): 1 I Celery sticks,(cut into  inch pieces): 4 I Canned tomatoes: 1 cup I Pitted large green olives: 6 I White wine vinegar:  cup I Basil leaves: 6 I Pinenuts:10 gms I Salt to taste I Sugar: 3 tsps.<b><br><br>METHOD </b><br><br>I In a colander,lay the eggplant and salt.Place the colander in a bowl;set aside for 30 minutes to drain.I In a flameproof casserole,heat olive oil over medium high heat.Add onion,garlic and celery and cook until celery is soft.Add tomatoes and olives,cook for another 10 minutes on slow heat.Turn off the heat.I Now,deep fry the eggplants in batches so that they are fully cooked.I Add the eggplants to the tomato mixture.Turn the heat to medium.Add vinegar and sugar to give it a sweet and sour taste.<br>Continue cooking for five minutes <br>and add salt if you like.<br>I Chop the basil and add to the <br>mixture along with pinenuts and serve hot.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/42/Img/Pc04211S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/42/Img/Pc04209S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>(Chef Nikhil Rastogi of The Park,New Delhi,serves Ritus Sicilian Caponata) </i></font><br>"},{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D42%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr04203%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"Treat that tuberculosis!","post":"Body BASICS <br><b>Treat that tuberculosis!

If pubs and bars are upping the revelry metre by introducing risqu night entertainment,cafes let your creative juices flow by mixing fun and creativity.Explaining the burst of creative outlets,hotelier Riyaz Amlani,promoter of Mocha,says,The new generation is so dynamic.Keeping the restless and on-the-move generation engaged is quite a challenge.Our idea is to make timepass more meaningful. <br>The buzz is not just at stand-alone joints;MNC chains too are reinventing themselves.A Caf Coffee Day outlet in Chennai turns into a virtual couch session as youngsters,even those in the earning bracket,pour in to discuss personal matters with the resident agony aunt.Java City in Bangalore holds jazz evenings,so does Hard Rock Caf in Delhi.<br>In the rush to reinvent,has coffee,the mainstay of a caf,taken a backseat Kunzums Ajay Jain sets no price for the tea,coffee and biscuits that make up the limited menu  instead,customers simply drop cash into a donation box.The idea is to allow people to spend time at the caf without an obligation to spend money, says Jain.<br>But is too much focus on stimulating the brain cells with creative doses taking the flavour out of the coffee One wonders if the new cafs would live up to formidable icons like Kolkatas The Coffee House,Bankura and Coffee Home in Delhi,Samovar at Jehangir Arts Gallery,Mumbai,and Bangalores Indian Coffee House and Koshys.Samovar is not a caf,it is an emotion, says author Shobhaa De.This is the place where Amitabh and Jaya dated,where M F Hussain painted.Would a visitor at a caf at Delhis Khan Market stand up and start a heated political debate the way it happened in The Coffee House <br>Says Kavitha Nambiar of Claytopia,Earlier active creative entertainment and good food were considered mutually exclusive.Today,its more culturemeets-inexpensive-comfort-food.Itll take time for new cafes to evolve into iconic places.\"<br>The new-age caf is part coffee shop,part library,part photo gallery,and,perhaps most importantly,part community centre.The old-world nostalgia might be missing,but it presents a whole new meaning to the word timepass!

</b>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <br>With saas-bahu soaps ruling primetime and lasting well beyond their natural timelines,its time for a change,says Anuradha Varma <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>TIMES NEWS NETWORK </i></font><br><br><br>ANANDI has grown up and instead of battling Dadisa for her education,she now packs pooris to perfection and dreams of married life with Jagya.Another serial bites the dust as Balika Vadhu joins the legion of saasbahu shows on television.Its not the first time either that an Indian soap has begun well,and then fallen low on expectations.<br>We all remember Mona Singh as the beauty beneath the braces in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin,but does anybody remember how the show ended Or,for that matter,how Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi or Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki turned out eventually While the American Ugly Betty makes for interesting reruns,its desi counterpart Jassi enjoys no shelf life as television channels and producers sacrificed content for TRPs.<br>While the hapless viewer often wonders why a serial maker doesnt just end a show instead of dragging it,those at the helm of affairs defend the trend.Rajan Shahi,producer of Bidaai,which recently introduced new characters after a leap of six years,insists that its a formula that works and audience lap up the kitchen politics.However,he confesses,Television is huge today and so is the money riding on it.Theres definitely a need to experiment and create a benchmark,but beyond a point,I cant take a risk. <br>In the last couple of years,we have seen reality t e l e v i s i o n push the envelope with shows like Sach Ka Saamna,which brought peoples secrets out of the bedroom and into the public drawing room and Bigg Boss,which in subsequent seasons has had people resorting to their baser instincts to survive.However,the world of soaps remains a sanitised one,with ideal bahus toiling in the kitchen in all their finery.<br>And,even as we look forward to the next season of reality shows Kaun Banega Crorepati or Dus Ka Dum,soaps continue without a break.Indian shows seem to lack the confidence of imports from the West,such as Friends,Two And A Half Men,Seinfeld and now White Collar that wrap up a successful seas o n,knowing viewers will be waiting when they are back.<br>Writer Vinta Nanda,who launched Tara in the 80s,which was among the first successful Indian soaps and reminiscent of todays dramatic twists and camera angles,remembers the fatigue that set in after keeping it on for five years.She says,After three years,the actors didnt want to act,the writers didnt want to write,but we had to carry on as it was a successful show and the channel didnt want to shut it down.We must get into seasons.People want freshness after 15-20 weeks. <br>JD Majethia,who chose to have a second season for his successful Baa,Bahu Aur Baby,says,We were confident that the audience would still be interested. They also decided to voluntarily call it a day with the comedy Khichdi  reintroduced as Instant Khichdi after a break  as we found it difficult to continue being funny on a regular basis.The script would have suffered. When a show ends well,it remains in the public mindspace.For instance,DVDs of the oldies Yeh Joh Hai Zindagi,Buniyaad or Ramayana are available,and Hum Log is being remade as Hum for Doordarshan.Purnendu Shekhar,writer of Balika Vadhu also blames the viewer.He remarks,When I wrote Astitva,a love story between a younger man and much older woman,people would tell me  Bahut thanda chal raha hai (its quite dull).I wanted to make a show about normal people,and in real life,every day is not dramatic. He accepts though,Its first business,then creativity.A new show may not click;its a big risk. And,if you were wondering why Balika Vadhu was dragging,heres the reason  it originally had 26 episodes.Purnendu reveals,Content-wise,it has now reached its fifth episode. <br>However,things may be changing.While Vinta believes that channels are open to newer ideas,Sab TV has stuck to comedy and social satires,like Lapataganj,inspired by novelist Sharad Joshis short stories.While the shows lack gloss,its a start.Anooj Kapoor,business head,Sab,says We have made a decision to stick to clean,wholesome,lighthearted stories. Yash Raj,too,tried their hand with new genres on Sony,with the now ended Mahi Ve,about a spunky,overweight girls quest for love and the crime thriller Powder.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/43/Img/Pc04312S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>A scene from Instant Khichdi </i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/43/Img/Pc04308S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Mona Singh in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahi </i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/43/Img/Pc04311S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Amitabh Bachchan hosts Kaun Banega Crorepati </i></font><br>"},{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D43%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr04302%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"My music gets affected","post":"\u000a      <b>My music gets affected </b>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <br>Its not easy being happily married when the presence of a former wife looms large,but Adnan Sami and third wife Roya are hanging in there,says Subhash K Jha <br><br><br>ADNAN SAMIS soft-spoken new wife Roya has no intention of moving out of their home because as she argues,no court would ask her to stay away from her husband.<br>Displaying no shred of anger after the story broke out about the honourable court ordering her out,Roya said,Ive been taught by my parents that wherever my husband stays is where I belong.I wouldnt like them to be proven wrong.As long as I have his love,all the troubles that come our way are ours to share and deal with. <br>It's not easy being happily married when theres so much pressure on the marriage from the outside.Says Adnan,Roya and I have our good days and bad days.But she is infinitely patient.When something comes in the news about the problem (read: former wife Sabah) I dont have to be apprehensive about her reaction.I know shell take it with a sigh and a smile and try to make me feel better.I dont know what Id do without that smile of hers. <br>The musician confesses,My music does get affected.In fact,my creativity was seriously impeded in the last one year when the sh.. t hit the ceiling.I coped somehow,recorded one of my most evocative number Noor-e-khuda for Karan Johars My Name Is Khan during this period.Now Im working much better.Roya is my muse,to counter all the bad news. <br>Adnan does everything to Roya feel special.I love buying her gifts.She also loves to buy me things.But we dont need to give things to one another to make each other feel special.We are just special for each other every second of our life together. <br>Roya displayed grace when Adnans second wife Sabah visited them last month.Sabah chose to dress in a burqa for the occasion.Fireworks were expected between the two wives.But Roya refused to bite the bait.Roya,Adnan says,isnt going anywhere.No one can ask any wife to leave her husbands home.Its against every law,natural or man-made.How would Sabah have liked if my first wife Zeba Bakhtiar thundered into the house and asked her to leave Adnan thundered after hearing of his former wifes family court order asking his current wife to vacate the premises of the home that the first wife claims belongs to her.<br>States Adnan,Roya is here to stay.My lawyer has appealed against the order.But the order never said my wife couldnt stay with me.Tell me which court in the world would issue such an order The family court order prohibits family and friends from staying in the house.Roya is neither.She is my wife. <br>Roya has told her husband she would abide by the law and continue to be supportive of every step that Adnan takes in his fight to restore normalcy in their lives.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/43/Img/Pc04307S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br>"}]},"44":{"index":44,"thumb":"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pg044_20.png","articles":{},"links":[{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D44%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr04400%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"Postcards from the Raj!","post":"\u000a      <b>Postcards from the Raj!</b>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <br>Storytellers on the steps of the Jama Masjid,old gramophone records,nautch girls Nona Walia recreates magic of the 40s <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>TIMES NEWS NETWORK </i></font><br><br><br>IT was an era of simplicity.The days of punkah-wallahs and palakis,of tonga rides and gramophones! The days of the Raj evoke nostalgia for something modern India can only romanticise about as we celebrate the 64th year of Independence.<br>As we move on,weve lost some things from the past that are imbued with a romantic aura.The charpois on the verandahs of Lutyens bungalows,with baggis in the corridors and rotary dial telephones in living rooms.Men going to college in pyjamas,women wearing saris in their family portraits.The walls festooned with sabres swords,Raj-era paintings and embroideries,the melody of KL Saigals voice from the gramophone  all flawless snapshots from another age,something the young generation of this decade will never experience.<br>These arent just glimpses from the past,but an integral part of our cultural configuration.The old was cast away and we value only the new.Who can forget the timelessness of the emotion Lata Mangeshkars Ae Mera Vatan ke logon stirred or the romance of sepia photographs ! Says Pavan Varma,author of Being Indian and Becoming Indian,It was an era that makes every Indian nostalgic.There was a certain simplicity in lifestyles as we travelled by tongas and ships.The aangan-kaghar was the original ancestral home,which has been forgotten because of mechanised flats.At that time,letter writing was considered an art.The music lyrics of the 40s were also of robust literary quality. <br>With time,cultural nuances changed and newer ways of living emerged.Says cultural entrepreneur Navina Jafa,who specialises in heritage walks,It was a time when culture suddenly changed almost overnight in the 40s.There used to be Kharkhano ki Zubaan,a special language which was spoken by those working in factories.Dont we miss the aangan vala ghar that triggered terrace romances and kite flying. <br>There was a euphoria of freedom,which expressed and manifested itself in the way everyone lived.Idealism set the mood those days.In the 1940s,the nautch girls were seen as prostitutes overnight as the courtesan culture ended.We celebrate the image of the original courtesan especially through cinema. In his book,Nautch Girls of India,author Pran Nevile talks about how the original nautch girls were a talented lot and went on to become the first generation of Bollywood stars.Cinema had replaced the gramophone era,hence brought about ripples of cultural change, says Nevile.According to art restorer Aman Nath,There was clean air and space,I would ride to school in a tonga for 25 paise.That makes me nostalgic. Ultimately,its the tangible items of the 40s that trigger waves of sentimentalism.The swish malls dont compare to the laziness of the bazaars and nautanki performers.Says Manjeet Bhullar,art restorer and designer,Everyone travelled with old steel trunks and bistarbands and rode in tongas,baggis and ikkas,food was all about slow-cooking;the Peshawari Katlama is rarely heard of today. Can cultural timelines get blurred as we move on I t h i n k s o, s ay s OP Jain,founder of Sanskriti Museum and conservator,We have to make an effort that the old and new are always connected,there has to be continuity.On the steps of Jama Masjid,there used to be three or four storytellers,who would sit and narrate tales,known as Kissa Kahaniyan experts! Thats something Nilabh Sinha,director of INTACH agrees with,We miss those huge film posters from a bygone era.Of course,one misses the 1940s Morris Minor,the small car that was seen in India.We dont see saris with family portraits anymore,worn by stylish ladies of yesteryears. <br>Photographer Avinash Pasricha on his sojourn to Mussorie would often sneak into TE Devin &amp; Company and listen to music on the gramophone.It was a timeless experience,youngsters today have formed communities to keep alive that music. <br>Yet,nostalgia cant recreate the lost legacy.Says architectural restorer,Sunita Kohli,Weve lost the past simplicity to materialism,theres a loss of moral uprightness.Those were the leisurely and less stressful times,culturally richer.It was an era which gave a different freedom.We valued it,as it was sacred. <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04414S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04413S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04409S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04408S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04410S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i></i></font><br>"},{"href":"http%3A%2F%2Fmobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D44%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOICH%26mydateHid%3D15%2D08%2D2010%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B%2D%2BChennai%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr04403%26publabel%3DTOI","title":"Book SHELF","post":"\u000a      <b>Book SHELF </b>\u000a      <br>\u000a      <br>THIS WEEK S PICK <br><br><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04411S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i><b>The Crimson Throne </b><br><br><b><br><br>Sudhir Kakar </b><br><br><b><br><br>Penguin Books India </b><br><br><b><br><br>Rs 450 </b><br><br>Three decades into Emperor Shah Jahans reign,while the monarch indulges in the pleasures of the flesh to divert himself from the travails of his ageing body,the country is bracing itself for the brutal  and inevitable  war of succession to the Peacock Throne.At this time of tumult,European travellers Niccolao Manucci and Francois Bernier arrive in India,and find their way into the innermost circles of the royals.While Manucci revels in his newfound fame as miracle healer to princesses and concubines,and Bernier records his cerebral interactions with the Omrah in the imperial court,they conjure up an enthralling panorama of an empire in crisis.</i></font><br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/44/Img/Pc04412S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i><b>The Thing About Thugs </b><br><br><b><br><br>Tabish Khair </b><br><br><b><br><br>Harper Collins </b><br><br><b><br><br>Rs 399 </b><br><br>Amir Ali leaves his village in Bihar to travel to London and befriends an English captain,William Meadows,to whom he narrates the story of his life  the story of a murderous thug.While Meadows tries to analyse the strange cult of the Indian Thug,a group of Englishmen sets out to prove the inherent difference between cultures and people by examining their skulls  an approach that has violent results.Set in Victorian London,this story of different voices from different places draws intricate lines of connection from the 19th to the 21st century,between England and India,across individual and cultural differences.</i></font><br>"}]},"45":{"index":45,"thumb":"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/45/Img/Pg045_20.png","articles":{},"links":[]},"46":{"index":46,"thumb":"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/15/46/Img/Pg046_20.png","articles":{},"links":[]}},"totalPages":46,"totSections":16}
