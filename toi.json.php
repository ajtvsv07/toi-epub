Grill,where they relaxed on an outdoor deck overlooking the water and ate a lunch of fish tacos,chicken tenders and burgers.After a quiet afternoon at their beachfront hotel,the Obamas headed into town for a family miniature golf outing.<br>The White House scheduled the trip after facing criticism that the president wasnt heeding his own advice that Americans vacation in the Gulf.Obama has vacationed in North Carolina and Maine this year and is heading to Marthas Vineyard,off the Massachusetts coast,later in August.Mrs.Obama also travelled to Spain this month with Sasha.<br>Gulf Coast residents and local officials are hoping the presidents stop here will jump-start the tourism industry,which has been reeling since the spill.Although only 16 of the 180 beaches in the western part of the Panhandle were affected by the spill,tourism officials say many potential visitors have stayed away,deterred by images of oil-slicked waters and tarball-strewn beaches in other parts of the region.<br>Its the biggest single commercial you could imagine, Florida Gov.Charlie Crist said of the presidents visit.Crist was among local officials and small business owners who joined Obama earlier in the day at a meeting to discuss the pace of recovery efforts.<br>Obama,who is on his fifth trip to the region since the spill,said he knows Gulf Coast residents have been frustrated by the slow payment of claims from a $20 billion BP fund for those who have suffered damages,and he pledged to rectify that.AGENCIES <b><br><br>Obama retracts on supporting mosque <br></b><br><br>President Barack Obama backed off remarks that appeared to endorse a Muslim cultural centre near the site of the Sept 11,2001,attacks in New York,saying he only supported the organizers right to build it.I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there, Obama told reporters while visiting the US Gulf Coast.I was commenting very specifically on the right people have that dates back to our founding.

incorporate a clause that gives veto power to all states.Any issue relating to GST will have to be agreed upon by all states once the bill is passed by Parliament by a two-thirds majority and by at least 15 assemblies.In addition,the Centre has agreed to insert another clause that provides liberty to states to disagree upon any diktat coming from the Council.<b><br><br>ONE COUNTRY,ONE TAX

the oil spill off Mumbai will be made to pay,the question of who is to pay may remain unsettled for a while owing to India\'s non-participation in an international treaty that deals specifically with the adverse effects of bunker fuel spilled by ships.<br>With over 300 hectares of mangroves along the western coast covered in fuel oil,which is considered heavier than crude and hence takes longer to disperse,the clean-up is expected to leave government with a hefty bill.But will India be able to expedite recovery of the amount from insurers of the two vessels,MSC Chitra and MV Khalijia,which collided and caused the disaster <br>Although a signatory to several international maritime conventions which set the guidelines and procedures for assessing environmental damage,India has not yet ratified the International Convention on Civil Liability For Bunker Oil Pollution Damage,or the Bunker Convention in short,which covers payoffs made to compensate for spillage of fuel from a vessel\'s tanks.<br>The Bunker convention is among recent treaties adopted by maritime nations to ensure prompt,effective compensation is made in case of spillage of bunker fuel from ships.Since most conventions relating to oil spillage focused on oil carried as cargo by commercial tankers,the need for a convention relating solely to spillage of bunker fuel was felt.Thus the Bunker convention was

likely to take up the issue of hike in salaries of MPs against the backdrop of an all-party consensus demanding that lawmakers be given a salary at par with secretaries to the government of India.<br>MPs currently get Rs 16,000 per month as salary while a secretary to the government gets Rs 80,000 a month.The proposal is to hike MPs salary to Rs 50,000.Lawmakers have pointed out that they are listed 21st on the warrant of precedence while secretaries come in at 23rd.<br>When a secretary gets Rs 80,000 a month,it is not justified to have Rs 16,000 as an MPs monthly salary, a parliamentarian,who did not want to be quoted,said.<br>Sources indicated that given the enormous pressure from MPs,the figure may be increased to Rs 60,000.The government plans to move a bill to hike MPs salaries in Parliament this week.The issue has been pending since May 2006 when the second joint committee to look into MPs salary was set up.The generous Sixth Pay Commission hike for central government employees,which was adopted by most state governments,added to the disquiet among MPs.<br>However,there are lingering questions whether the work done by MPs justifies this kind of salary.Eyebrows have also been raised over the fact that MPs give themselves the hike.Lawmakers counter that the salary given is too meagre for them to fulfill their myriad obligations to their voters and their constituencies.<br>The recommendation was made by a committee led by Charandas Mahant,a Congress MP from Chhattisgarh.The panel included MPs people from various parties,like V Maitreyan of

the famous Saraswati Mahal Library,and queens.The structures boast of a mix of Moghul and Dravidian temple architecture.But today,only a handful of shrines remain,that too in a dilapidated condition,with many having been encroached upon.<br>The site assumes significance as unlike in the north,where impressive royal memorial gardens,particularly belonging to the Mughal period,are found,Tamil Nadu has no such memorials except for Kailash Mahal.The place also shows evidence for prevalence of the Sati system practised by Maratha queens,which was otherwise uncommon in this part of the country, said Mayan,a historian.According to Mayan,the site once had inscriptions containing details in chronological order about kings and queens cremated there,but all those are missing

size=\"1\"><i>Julie Mariappan | TNN </i></font><br><br>Chennai: The state government has lost at least Rs 10 crore by giving away stone quarrying rights in Keerapakkam in the southern suburbs of the city to a private company doing civic work for the Chennai Corporation and highways department absolutely free.What is more,the corporation issued a recommendation letter to the Kancheepuram collector to speed up clearance.<br>Roman Tarmat,the company,was given the contract to construct storm water drains in the Central Buckingham canal water catchment areas like Mylapore and Royapettah for Rs 38 crore.Citing the requisition of the corporation,the Kancheepuram district collectorate has granted a lease to the company to mine 3.9 lakh tonnes of blue metal without participation in any auction or tender.The state government would have earned Rs 10 crore if the quarry had been auctioned.<br>Not only was the tender process not followed,the tonnage allotted to the miner was way above the requirement of less than 50,000 tonnes of blue metal.The district collector has given free mining rights to the company,citing Rule 7 of the Tamil Nadu Minor Minerals Rules 1959.What is left unsaid,however,is that the same rule says such rights can be given only if the products are used solely for bonafide public purposes and not for sale or commercial profits. <br>As the amount the company gets from the corporation for the storm water drain project includes the cost of materials,it become a commercial deal for which it cannot seek exemption.While the company would be paying only a nominal seigniorage fee for the blue metal it quarries,procuring 3.9 lakh tonnes of the material from the open market would have cost the company nearly Rs 7 crore.<br>Though the company has also bagged another project for the highways department,there seems to be no system in place to ensure that the rest of the blue metal would be used only for public work.<br>Government quarry operators are up in arms against the contract.For a small quantity of crushed blue metal,the company should not be allowed to mine blue metal worth crores of rupees.The government instead of generating revenue out of stone quarry,is losing its core revenue, said K Dhanasekar,president,Kancheepuram Stone Quarry Welfare Association.<br>The corporation maintained that there was nothing wrong in issuing the recommendation letter.The communique to the district collector was only to speed up the work, said SV Mathiazhagan,superintending engineer,storm water drains.It is a government policy to grant such lease when a department comes up with a requisition for their contractor, Kancheepuram collector Santosh K Misra told TOI.<br>About 33.5km of new drains will be laid in the Central Buckingham Canal catchment areas with the blue metal mined from Keerapakkam panchayat.<br>Meanwhile,Roman Tarmat has brushed aside the allegations.The district collector has granted the lease after ascertaining the prequalification for obtaining the lease under Rule 7.The raw material from the quarry will be used for specified public projects and will not be sold outside, said NV Natarajan,director,southern operations,Roman Tarmat.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/16/2/Img/Pc00208S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>BLATANT VIOLATION: The hillock is the part of the

of the keepers,who have done everything from clearing the land to planting trees,talk about their work <br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Priya M Menon | TNN </i></font><br><br><br>Schoolchildren crowd around the animal enclosures at Vandalur zoo,pointing and chattering excitedly.Even on a weekday,the zoo is packed.At the chimpanzees enclosure,Srinivasan watches them with a hawks eye,ensuring that no one throws plastic and hushing the children gently when they get too noisy.<br>These chimps are my friends, says Srinivasan,one of the zookeepers.I ensure that they are safe and healthy. For him,its more than just a job.Its been 25 years since Arignar Anna Zoological Park,also known as Vandalur zoo,was thrown open to the public but his association with it dates back even further.He is one of the few old-timers who actually helped set it up.<br>G Palani and I began working in 1979, says Srinivasan.Vandalur zoo is the first public zoo in India.It started out as a menagerie in 1854.Dr Edward Belford of Madras Museum got some rescued panther cubs and kept them near the museum.It attracted large crowds,so he thought of starting a zoo, says Dr Manimozhi,the zoo biologist.<br>In 1855,Dr Belford started the Madras zoo on the museum premises,and it was later transferred to the Madras Corporation.It was shifted to Peoples Park,near Central station in 1861.<br>Soon it was necessary to relocate it to an even larger area, says Manimozhi.The aim was to establish a zoologiacl park which would serve as an ex-situ (when a species is protected outside its natural habitat) conservation facility for the fauna of eastern and western ghats.At Peoples Park,there was a lot of air and sound pollution,and there was not enough space for the animals.Since many people lived in the area,it posed a health hazard to animals.<br>Work to shift the Madras zoo to Vandalur Reserve Forest began in 1976.People from surrounding villages were roped in to afforest the area.There was nothing but scrub jungle,and practically no tree cover, says Palani,who looks after the zebra,giraffe and ostrich.Both he and Srinivasan remember the days when they went scouting for seeds in Chengaslpet and the Madras Christian College campus.We have planted most of the trees here, Palani says proudly,patting the trunk of a nearby tree.<br>From the zoo director to the ground staff,all are thrilled to mark the zoos silver jubilee.We will promote the idea of animal adoption.The idea is to create awareness and a love for animals among people, says Dr KSSVP Reddy,zoo director.<br>Events with students during wildlife week in October and a zookeeper for a day programme are also on the cards.Today,the zoo draw over 16 lakh visitors a year,but old-timers like Palani and Srinivasan still remember the early days.We worked in the scorching sun,making enclosures,putting up signs,creating trails for different species and eco-friendly rest sheds, says Manimozhi,who has been on the staff since 1988.They also developed a record-keeping system with details of animals brought to the zoo.Today,the zoo is one of the largest in south-east Asia,with 146 species and 1,376 animals and about 50 keepers tend to them.We we were hired to clear bushes and work on the land, says Chelliah,who is eating lunch behind the enclosure for white tigers.Over time and with some training,they began taking care of the animals too.I had never been with wild animals,but felt no fear, he says.The keepers are at the zoo by 8.30am.They first check the animals and notify the authorities if anything is amiss.Enclosures are cleaned,water troughs filled and the animals fed.Animals and humans share an easy camaraderie.Gombe and Gowri come ambling when Srinivasan calls out to them.Clap,Gowri, he says,encouragingly,rewarding the chimp with a banana.<br>Since the keepers spend all day with the animals,they are a treasure house of information.Vandalur zoo is the leader of captive breeding programmes for the liontailed macaque,Nilgiri langur and Nilgiri tahr.The keepers are integral to the programme as they tell us when the animal is in heat or ill, says Manimozhi.<br>For the keepers,the zoo has become a second home.When I came,it was for daily wages.Now I have a government job and earn a basic salary of about Rs 6,000, says Chelliah.Palani adds,I am here every day from 8.30am to 5.30pm.I come check on the animals even if my children are sick.I cant think of doing any other job. <b><br><br>Zoo plans to tap rainwater this yr <br></b><br><br><b><br><br>D Madhavan | TNN <br></b><br><br>The Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur plans to set up rainwater harvesting systems,including small bunds and check dams,on its 1,265-acre campus.<br>Most of the present requirement of two lakh litres a day is met by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD).The rest comes from 13 open wells,five borewells and a lake.During the monsoon,after these fill up,the excess water goes untapped.Rainwater harvesting needs greater attention especially in zoos where a large number of species are maintained.It helps recharge the water table, said zoo director and chief conservator of forests KSSVP Reddy.<br>The existing rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have to be repaired.The need to tap rainwater is felt especially in summer when the level in most wells goes down and the lake dries up.Every year,a huge amount of rainwater goes untapped.RWH systems should not be restricted to houses and commercial buildings.Zoos too should have such systems, said Shekhar Raghavan,an RWH expert.<br>Apart from drinking,the zoo uses water to bathe animals,clean enclosures and keep the areas around them cool.Besides,an uninterrupted supply is also needed for the 16 toilets and nearly two dozen taps that serve visitors to the zoo.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/16/3/Img/Pc00314S.jpg\"><br><font

to be afraid","post":"CITY CITY BANG BANG <br><b>Freedom to be afraid </b><br><br><font size=\"1\"><i>Santosh Desai </i></font><br><br><br>In an Independence Day survey carried out by this newspaper,security forces emerged as the true guardians of the countrys freedoms,followed by media.Not surprisingly,politicians figured low down on this list.A majority were comfortable forgoing their privacy in the interests of national security,being open to the idea that government could monitor their phone calls and emails.What freedom meant to this group (admittedly a small sliver of India,but one that represents the most vocal and influential minority in the country) was the ability to move around freely and vote.The freedom to protest was not seen as a particularly important need,with only 6% of those polled indicating that this was a freedom they valued.<br>It is interesting that in a country which is powering ahead economically,the section that has gained most from the accelerated growth,is so wrapped up in fear and anxiety.Freedom for this group is being imagined in extremely narrow terms  it is sufficient to be able to move around unhindered and vote once every five years.What is of overriding concern is not using freedom but preserving it.Freedom in India is guaranteed by the constitution but lies in tatters in our minds,so afraid we are of losing it.<br>At one level,this is hardly surprising considering the spate of terrorist attacks India has been reeling under.There is trouble in many different parts of the country and the body count of civilians and security personnel seems to be mounting by the day.Kashmir,the northeast,the Maoistdominated areas,the Khap violence (incidentally the Khap Panchayat are seen as protectors of our values by 30% of this group),frequent disruptions caused by forces like the Shiv Sena,MNS and their ilk are all adding up to create an atmosphere of heightened insecurity and fear.Add to it the constant threat posed by Pakistan and its machinations,which we all hear of so frequently.<br>And yet,the truth is that India is seeing a decline in the number of people dying from acts of terrorism.According to the South Asian Terrorism Portal,2231 people died in terrorism-linked incidents in 2009,down from 2613 deaths the year before.In 2006,this number was 2775 and in 2001 it was as high as 5839.The figure for civilian deaths in 2009 was 720,down from 1019 the year before.In 2006,this numbered 1118 down from 1693 in 2001.The situation with Pakistan,though far from comfortable,has been much worse many times in the recent past,and we are certainly not sitting on the brink of an imminent war.<br>Of course,numbers tell only part of the story but it is noteworthy that most troubled areas lie outside the immediate perimeter of concern for the educated elite in India.Kashmir has always been on the boil and it has always been shrugged off as a law and order problem to be addressed by the military.The northeast is an area smothered by our indifference;it is barely acknowledged as a part of mainstream India and its angst is seen as an intrinsic part of their makeup,we think of it as part of who they are.Maoist violence has existed for years,as has the cause they represent but before economics got politicians interested,we routinely ignored these acts as irrelevant.So in a sense,the affluent educated elite has no reason to become insecure on account of these disturbances for they are leading to lower loss of life and continue to fester in regions in which this class has little or no interest.<br>Then why do we sense this new feeling of edginess,this sense of looming menace The Mumbai attacks have a lot to do with this.By attacking people in five-star hotels,the terrorists drilled a hole in our psyche,one which time has not managed to fill in.But more tellingly,it is media that has created a new ecology of fear,making us anxious about all that surrounds us.The media seems to be full of bad news ^ scandals around the CWG,roads that collapse at the first sign of rain,even cricket is full of scams and court cases and crime seems to be on the rise.The urban habitat seems to have become a receptacle of grim foreboding,as we breathe toxic fumes of self-doubt and anxiety.<br>The relentlessness of bad news,the competitive one-upmanship in creating doomsday scenarios,the total loss of perspective in news reporting creates a world without a sense of scale.The absence of proportion makes every event appear a catastrophe of a titanic scale.Take the example of the Commonwealth games  that the CWG are a hotbed of corruption seems clear but its actual scale is far from clear.Is it only about a Rs 1.5 crore order or is the problem a much bigger one How many stadia are incomplete  is it all of them or just a few that we are seeing and hearing about so frequently  Are the problems really serious or are they relatively easy to fix <br>Because the intention is no longer the reportage of the whole truth,but of that version of truth that makes for impactful viewing,perspective is burdensome.Deliberately or otherwise,this kind of reportage helps construct a climate of aggressive conformity and compliance.Ironically,greater apparent participation by the public begins to inhabit an increasingly narrow spectrum of opinion.The media is then,in danger of becoming an instrument of the state,rather than its conscience-keeper.<br>Of course,the climate of fear does not come from media alone.As a small part of India grows more affluent and has more to lose,and as its aspirations keep spiralling upwards,its sensitivity to any real and perceived disruptions grow dramatically.Fear keeps us from asking questions and makes us volunteer our freedom in exchange of certainty.Of course,the uncertainty we wish to banish is in significant part,a product of our own minds.<br>santoshdesai1963@indiatimes.com <br><img

people with disabilities,the organisers got around the rule not allowing them to light a fire inside the air-conditioned auditorium in a novel way.Social welfare minister Geetha Jeevan looked rather bewildered for a moment when she was called upon to light the lamp and inaugurate the camp.She looked around for the lamp but couldnt see the traditional kuthuvilakku.She was then directed to a laptop on the table and asked to light the lamp with a click of the mouse.<b><br><br>For a perfect shot </b><br><br>Footballers are known to be focused once they take to the fields only injury can prevent them seeing a game through to the end.At a recent all-India event held in the city,however,something did distract a player.The referee had blown the whistle for a throw-in and stopped play for a minute to check on an injured player.After making sure the player was fine,he blew the whistle again for the game to start.But the game did not start.The reason: the player holding the ball for a throw-in was busy posing for a television camera on the sidelines,and had missed the referees signal.It took some laughs and the referee coming over to drag the player away from the camera to resume play.<b><br><br>The stars of Broadway </b><br><br>Broadway,one of Madrass oldest roads,is today known as Prakasam Salai.The road,as one learned during a walk organised during the ongoing Madras Week celebrations,has many first to its credit.The road had the citys first jail (now turned into Bharathi Womens College) and the first permanent cinema hall,known as Mrs Blugs Bioscope.It was here that the citys publishing industry began.But not many may know why Broadway was renamed Prakasam Salai after Independence.During countrywide protests against the Simon Commission in 1928,the road witnessed a mini Jallianwala Bagh-type episode on February 3.A huge procession was marching through,and as it reached the China Bazaar Road end,one nervous policeman fired at the crowd.One man called Parthasarathy died.Police immediately announced that anyone stepping out to claim the body would also be shot.But a Congress leader called T Prakasam tore open his shirt,daring the police and rushed forward to claim the body.Prakasam went on the become the first chief minister of Madras after Independence,and subsequently the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.<b><br><br>Talk and action </b><br><br>An inspector in north Chennai says hes found a way to deal with drunks picked up on the street: he talks to them.They come to their senses quite quickly after a sermon on the ills of alcoholism and its effect on the family, the policeman said.Other officers,however,said the talks sometimes go on for so long that they have an unexpected,sobering effect on the alcoholics.<b><br><br>The sum of fun </b><br><br>Recently,maths teachers got a set of helpful guidelines from an organisation claiming to make teaching fun.But the teachers got a laugh out of the rather pedagogical tone of the hints to make maths lighter.Mathematics teacher and humour do not go together.A smile in the face will make all the change in the classroom atmosphere, preached one of the helpful hints.Another exhorted them to Grade the problems in the textbook from easy to difficult.Since success leads to success and failure breeds failure,make sure the students succeed.

audience,filling the seats and overflowing onto the sand,sat listening to the performance oblivious to the smells wafting from the many bajji stalls and the din from the amusement rides nearby.<br>Selvaganesh had the audience rocking with his long round of konnakol,the vocal percussion style.Thakita,dikita,thomkita,namkita,he chanted and repeated in various combinations and at varying speeds.His brother Uma Shankar joined in occasionally,drawing more cheers from the crowd.Selvaganesh drew admiring laughter from them as he urged them to clap and shout dhom at various intervals and speeds.Quick on the uptake,the audience soon took to clapping to the beat of the ghatam and kanjira.<br>A hush fell as Shrinivas began his performance with his own composition for Independence Day,titled Namma Bharatam.Based on the three ragas,panthuvarali,abheri and vakulabharanam,the tune took on subtle moods and variations.While his rendition of the panthuvarali depicted purity and divinity,the song acquired a brighter,more vibrant edge as he swiftly changed to the abheri raga,and finally the notes of vakulabharanam added solemnity to the music.Shrinivas shifted moods and ragas effortlessly as the tinkling of the mandolin resounded against the crash of the waves in the background.<br>After each of them finished their soulful solos,they pitted their skills against each other in a brief thani avarthanam,where each played to the same rhythm on their own instrument.The jugalbandi had youngsters on their feet,cheering and whistling,and older members of the audience clapping furiously.The artists seemed to make their instruments converse with each other,creating a pulsating energy.<br>The concert was punctuated by witty asides and comments by Selvaganesh and some interesting displays on the kanjira to show the range of the tiny but powerful instrument.Declaring that his kanjira could take on any classic drum kit,Selvaganesh set out to produce sounds of a bass drum,a snare,a hi-hat,the toms and the cymbals.<br>The evening ended with a stirring rendition of the bhajan Raghupathi Raghava,which Shrinivas dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi,and the music seemed to hang in the air long after the last notes had faded.<br>All events and performances at The Times Chennai Festival are free.The cohost for the event is Sheraton Park Hotel and Towers.<br><img

information commissions directive.<br>Balasubramaniam is not alone to draw a blank.V Gopalakrishnan,an activist in KK Nagar,said there were halfa-dozen queries for which he did not receive information

in Thirupukuli village,about 20km from Kancheepuram,along the Bangalore Highway.The statue is said to be 1,000 years old.<br>Early on Saturday morning,a few persons came on a tractor to the river bed and started digging.One of them heard an unusual sound made by his implement and he realised he had hit a stone object.<br>The men swifty removed the sand and pulled out the object,which turned out to be a beautiful Perumal statue made of sandstone.Immediately they rushed to the nearby village and informed the residents,who in turn informed village administrative officer H Kumar.<br>Hundreds of villagers followed Kumar to the spot.This is the first time such an ancient idol has been found in our village, Kumar told TOI.<br>By the time he informed officials of the Kancheepuram district administration about the discovery,women had begun garlanding the idol and worshippng it by burning camphor.<br>Revenue divisional officer (Kancheepuram) S Palani,along with other district officials,came to the spot and took the idol to the Kancheepuram taluk office,where it is on display.The idol is about 5ft tall and weighs over 100kg.The stone is similar to the one used in the Kailasanath temple in Kancheepuram.We have informed Archaeological Survey of India officials in Chennai.They are supposed come tomorrow, Kancheepuram tasildar P Varadarajan told The Times Of India on Sunday.<br>A state government archaelogical official who inspected the idol on Saturday evening said it must be at least 1,000 years old belonging to the Pallava era.The Kailasanath temple was built by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman II in the early eight century and subsequently Chola king Rajaraja Chola I visited it.The temple is now maintained by the ASI.<br>According to officials of the HR&amp;CE department in the district,an ancient Perumal temple was found in the village many decades ago but was washed away in floods.But the temple well is still in existence.Saturdays finding could be related to the washed-away temple,the officials felt.<br>madhavan.d@timesgroup.com <br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/16/5/Img/Pc00512S.jpg\"><br><font

motors to small farmers.<br>Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association secretary,S Ranganathan,said,We appreciate the chief ministers gesture.I request the government to give submersible motors instead of mono-block ones.Also,a majority of small and marginal farmers dont have power connection.The state should look at the possibility of providing motors and power connections to those people also by clubbing them as small groups. <br>Ranganathan lamented that though the government promises six hours of power supply during day and three hours at night to the farming community,the supply was highly irregular and not dependable.Even if we get eight hours of supply,it is enough,but there should be certainty about it, he said.For marginal (those with a landholding of up to one hectare) and small (between one and two hectares) farmers,agriculture is not merely an economic activity,but their livelihood.They hold about 56% of the state land area.<br>The average land holding of farmers in the state,which was 1.25 hectares in 1976-77,has gone below 0.8 hectare now.It is much lower than the national average of 1.33 hectares.<br>According to an estimate of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India,Tamil Nadu Electricity Board spends roughly Rs 1,200 crore per annum for providing free power to farmers.Agriculture power connections,which increase by roughly 2% per annum,constitute about 9% of the total TNEB subscriber base.Further,unlike the domestic sector,all connections in the agri sector are three-phase connections.<br>The scheme to give motors to farmers is not totally new.From 2009 onwards,the state has been giving 50% subsidy to 10,000 farmers per annum (roughly Rs 10 crore) to buy new motors.<br>At the Independence Day celebration,Karunanidhi also distributed state government awards to various people.The Kalpana Chawla award was given to differently-abled athlete J Deepa of Madurai.She has won many medals in the international level athletics competitions.<br><img src=\"http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/TOICH/2010/08/16/5/Img/Pc00514S.jpg\"><br><font size=\"1\"><i>ALL SMILES: CM M Karunanidhi distributing a housing deed to a
